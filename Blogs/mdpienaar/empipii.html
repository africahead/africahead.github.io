            When capitalist reasoning claims maximum profit per individual is problematic for society, it often causes strong and spirited
            (excited) opposition, partly because the current capitalist system is highly dependent on maximum-profit-per-individual
            (empipi-i). Apart from the psychological influence, empipi-i has, non-profit organisations get their funding from empipi-i
            organisations. Empipi-i and non-profit organisations are inherently linked in the current capitalist system.</p>

          <p>Current socialist and current capitalist politics are not very different, although the supporters of the two systems
          are in opposition. The main difference is, in socialism, governments pay grants and in current capitalism non-profit organisations
          pay charity. Who control the money, from which the grants and charity are paid, is the most important difference, because
          they also determine how the "profits" it is paid from, are generated. Socialism focuses more on the Labour Theory of Value/Capital,
          which Marx promoted. Capitalism, because of religious ritual, allows for more creativity than at socialism. Most capitalists
          however also convict in the Labour Theory of Value, whilst disrespecting creative ideas, which originate labour.</p>

          <p>There need be an effective argument against empipi-i to show why it is not good for capitalist society. The inequility
          it causes is regarded a part of life and "nature", and many despots do not entertain arguments against empipi-i. They, for
          example, claim, people who oppose empipi-i, are jealous of the most wealthy people, which is not always true.</p>

          <p>The reason empipi-i is not "good", can be found in the quantity theory of money. According to the quantity theory of money,
          for example, the USD/ZAR exchange rate is roughly all South African assets valued in United States Dollars (USD), divided by,
          all the South Africa Rands (ZAR) printed.</p>

          <p>A silly result of empipi-i is exorbitant (unnecessary) wealth, which vests at a small percentage of a society. It is
          possible, because too much money is printed. If a limit is placed on individual wealth, less money can be printed and therefore
          capitalism will become more sustainable.
