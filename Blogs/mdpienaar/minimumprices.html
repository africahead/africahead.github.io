<p>According to the economic theory of <em><a href="../../Africahead/Intequinism.html">Intequinism</a></em>,
minimum prices will maximise brand values, not maximum prices. This article motivates this claim, and explains it further.</p>



<p>The most important reason <em>Intequinism</em> posits that, asking minimum prices, is better methodology
than maximum prices, is because, maximum prices increase the difference between the rich and the poor, which eventually cause
revolutions/wars. <em>Intequinism</em> promotes gradual changes, not revolutionary changes.</p>



<p>Maximum prices indicate the greed, inherent to the current capitalist system. It is kind of stupid.
When you for example give a professional service to a client and the well-being of the client is a consideration, maximum prices are
obviously not logical. A good example is medical service. Privatised hospitals listed on stock exchanges, which must ask maximum prices,
to maximise dividends paid to shareholders, cannot reconcile the well being of patients with maximum prices. The unhealthy stress alone,
maximum prices cause, at poor and middle class people, proves this. This example about medical service is an extreme, but to a lesser
extent buying anything, is similar.</p>



<p><em>Ipparts Exchange</em> (<em><a href="../../Africahead/IppartsExchange.html">IPPAEX</a></em>)
is a new cryptocurrency exchange being developed. Some tokens traded on <em>IPPAEX</em> will use <em>Intequinism's</em> economic theory,
according to which minimum prices are charged, to maximise the value of brand tokens. All the brand tokens, listing on <em>IPPAEX</em>
need not use <em>Intequinism's</em> economic theory though. Businesses will have to state what their policy is. <em>IPPAEX</em>
resolves the problem of greed, inherent to the current capitalist system. At startup businesses, minimum prices exist only in idea
form. Startup businesses usually ask maximum prices to get going. <em>IPPAEX</em> resolves the problem the system causes, when
businesses get big, and list shares on stock exchanges. Stock Exchanges require maximum prices, because maximum dividends must be paid.
Some people get caught up in situations they probably would prefer not to be. Donating to non-profit organisations, often resolves the
problem, helping to keep others on the breadline. The pity however, included in donations, all people do not enjoy. On <em>IPPAEX</em>
such problems are not relevant because the value of <em>ipparts</em> (intellectual property parts) will not be increased by maximum
prices and maximum dividends. The competition will be about minimum prices, because minimum prices will leave more cash, directly,
in the pockets of consumers. It also removes the divide between owners and consumers. Currently consumers pay maximum prices,
which enrich the "elite" who are owners. Maximum prices benefit owners but disadvantage consumers. According to a system of
minimum prices, consumers and owners, both benefit from prices. Owners benefit because brand values increase and consumers
benefit because they pay lower prices.</p>



<p>The other day someone asked me what minimum prices are. He asked whether he would be able to
buy himself an aeroplane, if his business asked minimum prices. My answer was, i don't know, because minimum is not a fixed concept.
Minimum prices will be determined by competition. It is different for each person. When i started <em>Africahead</em>, and started
promoting minimum prices, 20 years ago, a salary of 4 million ZAR per year, was in my mind. That was a salary i thought reasonable
to include in prices of <em><a href="../../Africahead/Moiom.html">Moiom</a></em>; the trading name of the
business then. These days it will be lower though, because i am less greedy. Minimum prices will also depend on sustainability.
Enough must be included in minimum prices to make provision for retirement of all employees. Expansion is another consideration.
Reserves must be formed with enough capital to grow. These days some maximum-profit-per-individual (<em>empipi-i</em>) businesses
have very large cash balances and they do not know what to do with it all. Yesterday the news reported, Amazon will pay for retraining
of employees' new careers, if they want it, even if Amazon's services do not include those careers currently. It looks like a good idea.
Minimum prices could include that idea, to a certain extent. Minimum prices are ideas in development. The practical application could
be a new field of study. Another part of <em>Intequinism's</em> economic theory is, tax can be printed. It is not necessary, after the
gold standard was dropped, to charge taxes. If taxes are not charged, prices can be dropped dramatically. Perhaps some places are
already doing that, without making it public knowledge, who knows.</p>



<p>The most important part of maximum prices, minimum prices exclude, is the part paid to certain
non-profit organisations, especially some religious institutions, because of the victimisation, ostracism and pity, involved in
their system. The idolatrous implications of it is a disgrace. It is clear, that system, does not work properly and it would be
better for those people to work for government, where their work can be planned better, without preying/predating and parasitising,
in the workings of idolatry's empipi-i.</p>
