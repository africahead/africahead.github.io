            <h2>God and Satan</h2>
            <p>First published: Easter Saturday, 20 April 2019</p>
            <p>
              The words God and Satan are used for Intequinism, because much of Intequinism originated, with a Christian background.
              I was accused, at a university's dismissal hearing, of thinking "I" am "God like Jesus", partly because doing honest
              research, was regarded an impossibility. It was good, the accusation finally came out, after many years, because until then,
              it was only insinuated. At least, after the accusation, manifest words existed, to work with. The attorney who opposed me,
              wrote my
              work was like eating cake and keeping it.
              The academic freedom clause of South Africa's Constitution is not respected. It happens in conjunction with a disrespect of
              the law in general, fueled with thoughts; real men do not need the law, because only they, protect themselves and their families.
              "He" cannot protect
              himself, because "He" is "the-individual", always weak, on his own; the satanist group prerogative, using ostracism and
              isolation.
              Most, regard pragmatic "moral holidays" necessity to survive. A minister of religion even preached, not long ago, South Africans
              must lie, to show they have conviction in the mercy of "God". That sounds more like a description of Satan, who
              suffer Caiaphas Syndrome, accusing the-honest of thinking they each "is God". Satanists use writings of Paul in the Bible
              to motivate their actions. "My lords" of the courts were influenced negatively,
              not being able to uphold the rights of "the individual" as opposed to "the group's" will. I came to the conclusion, due to the
              circumstances currently in South Africa, individuals do not have the necessary protection against mob slander and intimidation.
              The result will be hindering of good new creative ideas, unless South Africa divides, as planned in Divided Party (DiP).
              The main reasons are, Caiaphas Syndrome and the so-called singularity of God, making Satan irrational.
            </p>
            <p>Intequinism came into being under Christianity, emphasising the idea Love, and my parents emphasising the idea Truth.
              An important difference between Christianity and Intequinism is, Intequinism rejects idolatry totally. Therefore
              "the-individual" (individuals) each, does not have a "mentor" or "leader", replacing God. According to
              Intequinism, many Christians make an idol of Jesus, and therefore, territories cannot be shared between Christians and
              the-honest. Christianity has too many negative influences on honest people with regard to stolen "intelligence" and idolatrous
              accusations. When
              persons uphold values, found in Christianity, they are accused of thinking they each is God, Mother Of God or the Father.
              The source of the accusations is the idolatrous idea of a "Messiah", which was also the idea used to make an idol of Jesus.
              He and Buddha, i.e. opposed idolatry and idols were made
              of them. According to Intequinism, the Messiah or Lucifer, the outcast; two individuals, never existed,
              do not exist, and shall never exist.
            </p>

          <p>God are comprehended in connection with upholding the ideas Truth and Love. Satan, thus, are those who oppose the two ideas.
            The best way to deal with them, when push comes to shove, is avoidance and forgiveness. That is partly why Divided Party has
            different Houses. 
            Here as well Christianity is relevant. "Those who are not in favour of Intequinism, are against it." "Those who are not
            against Intequinism are in favour of it." Not one of these statements are correct, because the generalisations are too wide.
            It does not include those for their own -isms, who are not for or against Intequinism. Satan, thus, are those
            against Intequinism. Those who go out of
            their way to hamper Intequinism in a sly underhand way. Critique and debate is encouraged. If someone openly critiques
            Intequinism, and is willing to reason about it, it's not a problem. Satanists, however, normally lapses into cosmological
            rage, or become touchy-pushy, when discussing relevant topics. They can learn from ontology, valuing agreement, based on
            definitions, as opposed
            to agreement as result of despotism and metaphoric indoctrination.
            Many Christians who are very quick
            to argue, all sins are forgiven, because Jesus dies for their sins, are actually satanists. Every human dies for his/her own
            sins and the words "gods" and "goddesses" have only historical fallacious significance. Stealing good ideas ("intelligence")
            from living honest loving creative people, and developing the ideas, causes much materialistic wealth. Some argue, that is proof,
            Jesus died for their sins. According to Intequinism it is fallacious arguments, because it does not consider life after death,
            and the possibility of parallel universes.
            With all the metaphoric indoctrination about Father, Mother and Son, etc. it is difficult to realise, indoctrination about the
            "One" human causes
            satanism. It weakens the good, with isolation. That is why often, "the good die young".
          </p>  
          <p>Irrationality, due to Caiaphas Syndrome, makes Satan choose evil as survival methodology. There are however arguments,
            to restore rationality, and overcome the syndrome. A person can ask him/herself hypothetical questions, positing apocalyptic
            circumstances. Let's say hypothetically, conditions deteriorate
            to a disastrous level and a majority of people, due to indoctrination about "One" and "Unity", identify one and say "He"
            is Christ or the Messiah. Will self agree with the majority's satanism? I will not agree with the hypothetical majority lie,
            whether i am the hypothetical one or not. If another one is called "God Himself" and he says he is not Christ or the Messiah,
            because it is a fallacious idea, like John predicted, i will agree with him. This hypothetical reasoning nullifies the ideas
            Messiah and Christ, for the lie it is. Another argument to get over the indoctrination about "One" and "Unity", which causes
            Caiaphas Syndrome, is making a choice
            between the powerful God and a weak "God". I believe God are powerful and the indoctrination about a weak "God" causes satanism.
            The reason is simply, one person cannot oppose a large evil group. Religious ideas isolate good individuals, allowing groups
            to gang up against them. Evil spreads like cancer in "Unity". It grows until it collapses systems.
          </p>  
          <p>Evil infiltrating the law, to such an extent, universal laws, are not valued anymore, especially with regard
            to criminality, for example intimidation, and crimen injuria,  signals degeneration. Crimen injuria in
            the form of slander, and intimidation in the form of gang-stalking is the first line of attack by satanists. Intequinism
            does not promote attacking at all. Defence is the right way, according to traditional defence forces, simply because if no
            attacking happens everyone will be at peace. It's complicated, for example when others need help, whilst being attacked by
            satanists. Crimen injuria and
            intimidation are attacks, partly why it's criminally offensive. Satanists attack and offend, initially, behind their victims'
            backs.
            The idea Love was
            the source of universal laws;
            not-doing evil to others like selves do not want evil done to. When the law does not respect Love anymore, downward
            spirals are unstoppable in a "Union". The only
            way to prevent a future collapse of South Africa is division between good and evil, because, in the current "Unity",
            evil has become cancer and grows uncontrollably. The only way democracy can stop the deterioration is voting for self-determination
            of all groups/folks, against "Unity", a dialectical essence. Caiaphas Syndrome, caused by idolatry in religions, is the primary
            cause to blame.
            Most people fell
            for the thought, if self tries to be good, then self thinks, self is God. Referring to "Jesus died
            for our sins": In my view, the doctrine of Jesus dying
            for our sins
            came into being, because in the Old Testament creativity was regarded a sin, because only God had the right to be creative.
            The changes, creativity caused were the prerogative of the nobility. All creative ideas belonged to the noble and religious despots.
            That was the main reason the Free Masons came into being. They also appropriate others' ideas and develop it, being
            close enough
            to the money generating system, to easily raise capital for development. The system allows it, because ideas are common property.
            Democratising development of ideas, is one
            of the main differences between monarchy and democracy. Not enough however, because the utilitarian evil satanist
            system, secularised religious ideas into Constitutions, which make ideas common property, without the requirement of acknowledging
            the sources, with remuneration or otherwise. The universal law against plagiarism, is not enough to see justice happen, when good
            ideas, forming new capital, are stolen.
          </p>

          <p>Another important argument, to overcome the indoctrination about God, being one human, is English grammar, in which capitalised
            letters, mean plural. Sometimes "Man" is used, which also refers to plural form. It takes time to get used to it though, but is
            possible. Many English people themselves have not overcome the indoctrination, because they find it necessary to use the word
            "Gods". In my view "Gods", lapses back to idolatry, making a distinction between humans and "gods" and "goddesses", as was done
            before Christianity. The word God in Intequinism refers to Logos and all living honest loving people. All living honest loving
            people can never form a visible group. God are international, without borders. Logos, defined in the ideas
            Truth and Love, and undefined metaphysically, makes God almighty. God can never be overcome by evil, because evil can never identify
            God. God shall never become evil, but when the-evil realise the logic, God were formed and form from, peace will prevail, because then
            Satan will become part of God. Before then division is necessary, because of the cancerous nature of evil in "Unity".
          </p>
          <p>Considering Truth and Love. Previously the realisation dawned, the idea Truth formed first and the idea Love is in formation.
          How did Love affect Truth? Before Love came into being, rhetoric and lying was an important part of education. Aristotle, i.e. wrote
          knowledgeable men knows how to lie. It is the dialectical essence of pragmatism and empiricism. According to Intequinism, Love means
          partly, not lying to all others like selves do not like being lied to. Love thus, excludes the negative side of the idea Truth, which
          is currently used in spinning, for example. It has implications for sexuality. According to Intequinism, male or female nature,
          cannot be
          linked to either Truth or Love, because both ideas are relevant in each human, without one or the other being dominant at males or
          females. All humans must eventually be born with both ideas, present, a priori. Yesterday i could explain it better, but the logical
          reason is not available today.</p>
          
          <p>Lastly, those who say God have no human parts; God is completely metaphysical/cosmological. They promote evil, because evil can
          only be overcome with God (Not-self alone); partly humans.
