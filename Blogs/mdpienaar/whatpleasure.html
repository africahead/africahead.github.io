            <p>First published: 4 July 2019</p>
            
          <p>Africahead is run, using <em>Intequinism</em>, as its foundation.<em> Ipparts Exchange</em> is currently the primary
          objective at Africahead. This article gives more information about how the economic theory of <em>Intequinism</em>,
          could influence <em>Ipparts Exchange</em>.</p>

<p><em>Ipparts Exchange</em> is a crypto-currency exchange where <em>brand</em> tokens can be listed. The tokens must be backed
by Intellectual Property, free to be monetized and traded.</p>

<p>According to <em>Intequinism's</em> new-capitalist economic theory, minimum fees maximize brand values, maximum fees
don't. Why is <em>Intequinism</em> a new-capitalist economic theory, not socialist or communist theory? Communism and Socialism
emphasize the Labor Theory of capital. Marx, from whom Communism originated, wrote, labor is "the creator". The Nazis, who
were the most recognizable in socialist ideals, used the slogan "Labor Makes Free", above the entrances to their death camps.
Although most "capitalists" have socialist convictions, when regarding roles of labor and ideas, recognition is given in
Christianity to capital of ideas (<em>intequity</em>). Sacrificing and praising "God", who "generates" good ideas, show
contradictory recognition however. It is contradictory because the origination of supposedly good Christianity, was in
pagan satanist sacrificing of people with good ideas. According to <em>Intequinism </em>ways must be found for idea generators
and people focusing on labor, to work well together.</p>

<p>Asking minimum prices, can practically only become relevant after a business has grown to a large enough size where
economies of scale warrant minimum prices. Most businesses never reach such a 'stage'. Therefore the idea is currently
more relevant for the emotive effect, than the actual practical application, of it. The practical effect looked for,
is limiting own wealth, in order for others to have more. Not asking maximum fees, if <em>Ipparts Exchange</em> is ever
that lucky, the effect will be: More cash in the hands of buyers and sellers.</p>

<p>All the brand tokens, which will list on <em>Ipparts Exchange</em>, will not have to comply with the economic theory
of <em>Intequinism</em>. The only compliance necessary, to consider, is South African law and whatever economic theory
is preferred.</p>
