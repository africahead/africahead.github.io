            <p>First Published: 31 July 2019</p>
            
          
<p>An article written and published at Medium.com, called "Ipparts Exchange (IPPAEX)" has now changed into an article about
Africahead, because the ideas of <em>Intequinism,</em> are applicable only to Africahead Ipparts (AFA) <em>brand tokens</em>.
Other <em>brand tokens</em> being listed on IPPAEX will be subject to other philosophies, to maximise those tokens' values.</p>



<p>Maximising utility value for consumers, means minimising the prices/royalties asked for utilities. With "utilities" i
refer to products, consumers use and pay for. Books, e.g. are utilities. The less a product costs, the more the utility
value is. Minimising prices via competition is an objective of capitalist economics, explained by Adam Smith. The problem
of current capitalism is, however, imperialists, acting against consumers, hinder this minimisation process, with
anti-competitive despotic behavior against fair competition. Ultimately it boils down to the use of illegal pragmatic
violence, "the group" is guilty of, against "the individual" and "the people". Many consumers take sides with imperialist
despotism, whilst choosing the mean (middle way) and becoming the mean (despots).&nbsp;The mean exists in being a
consumer and being dependent for retirement, on public listed stock exchange companies.</p>



<p> <em>Intequinism</em> promotes minimum prices/royalties. According to <em>Intequinism</em>, prices/royalties are
not minimised by competition among despots, against consumers ("the-individual" and "the people"), because despots
compete among themselves, to have the most materialistically. They aim for maximum prices of the products they sell,
whilst pitying others with charity. Prices are minimised according to <em>Intequinism</em>, primarily because i disliked,
pitying others with donations. Minimising prices turned out to be a competition with self and despotism. Where is my limit,
in order to give maximum utility value of my work, to other people. It raises the question; are people divided or not?
Am i part of "the people" or not? "We the people" have some among us who chose the mean, and therefore they are Humpty
Dumpty, sitting on the wall. I am now 50 and have been part of the people all my life, because i always had to budget.
I have never been in a position where a budget for personal expenditure, was not in my mind. The level of budgeting
differed substantially, from, including two restaurant meals per day every day, to no restaurant meals. That indicates
the relativity of my budgeting i refer to, in claiming i have always been part of "the people". Definitions can also
cause motivation for identifying more with nobility in the antique sense of the word, when "noble" and "honest" were
synonyms. A problem then was, it was possible to be despotic and honest. The idea Love developed with democracy, to
balance the idea Truth. The last 20 years i have also been part of "the-individual", apart from "the people". "The-group"
exists in opposition to "the-individual" and "the people." "The-group" are the despots who chose the mean.</p>

<p><em><a href="../../Africahead/IppartsExchange.html">Ipparts Exchange (IPPAEX)</a></em> is a new cryptocurrency
exchange where <em>brand tokens</em> can be listed. Moyom (MYM) ERC20 Ethereum utility token, is the currency of IPPAEX.
It is a solution to help solve the inequity of current capitalism. The exchange grew out of <em>intequity</em> (capital of ideas),
a new word, formed by combining "integrity" and "equity"; The exchange is run on available infrastructure, until enough capital is
available to build an own platform.</p>



<p>What is meant by&nbsp;<em>brand</em>&nbsp;<em>token</em>? The simplest way to explain it, is to refer to physical assets and
monetary liabilities of an organisation or individual. When the liabilities are deducted from physical assets, the result is,
the value, owners of an organisation own, or an individual owns. I will refer only to organisations, but most things can be
applicable to an individual, who runs a business on his/her own. A problem in my view of using one's own name is, after death,
a unique business name, not referring to an individual, is more marketable. A unique business name, not referring to an individual,
carries value better over time, in my opinion. Personal preferance differ though. Brands, referring in name, to deceased individuals
exist. This raises a question, i did not think about previously. I, for example, ceded all my copyrights of the past and the future
to a close corporation (CC) called Moiom CC t/a Africahead. Currently i work to increase the brand value of Africahead. Did that
cession legally include the use of my name, by only Africahead? That was not my intention, and if any doubt exists about that,
this article confirms my intention; Africahead will control the use of my name after my death and Africahead controls the use of
my name, whilst i am controlling Africahead.&nbsp;If a situation ever exists whereby i do not control Africahead, whilst i am alive,
my intention with the cession, was not to sign my name away to Africahead. I mention these matters, partly because it is matters,
organisations or individuals, who decide to list <em>brand tokens</em> on <em>IPPAEX</em>, can consider.</p>



<p>The Oxford Dictionary defines "going concern" as follows: "a business that is operating and making a profit.
<em> trying to sell the business </em><strong><em>as a going concern</em></strong>."</p>



<p>If organisations without saleable Intellectual Property are liquidated, physical assets are sold, and the creditors and
the lenders are paid. What is left, goes to owners. If an organisation is not liquidated and it is sold as “going concern”,
normally, the value is more than when it is liquidated. In accountancy the difference between the “going concern” value
and the liquidation value, can be called goodwill, brand value etc. of the organisation. That difference can be made up
of Intellectual Property assets, which cannot be seen on the balance sheet of the organisation. The value could be vested
in a trade mark. It could be vested in the name of the owner who helped building the organisation. Just the fact;
organisations are “going concerns”, gives organisations higher values than the liquidation values. “Going concern”, means
basically, people can “make a living” by working in/for the organisation. Maybe patents and/or copyrights represent the
difference-value between "going-concern" and liquidation values. Numerous explanations, depending on the circumstances,
can show the difference between the “going concern” and liquidation values.</p>



<p>An important realization is, the difference-value can only be monetized by selling it. Selling it is the only way it
can appear on a balance sheet. The difference-value can also be used to earn royalties, i.e. on copyrights, not recorded
on a balance sheet. In Africahead's case however earning royalties, is not feasible, because my works are too opposed to
the current socialist system, which degrades <em>intequity</em> (capital of ideas) in favor of labour and networking.
International Accounting Standards prohibit the capitalisation of Intellectual Property assets on which royalties are
applicable, unless it is sold. If royalties are applicable, an author can make a living from it, but royalties imply an
author is within the system of royalties. My work does not resort in the royalty system, because i have sold only one
book in about 5 years. Yet, words i coined, e.g. <em>intequity</em>, are used widely in the imperial system. That is
partly why i am sure my work has a value, which can be monetized, even though royalties do not apply. Selling goodwill,
is normally only possible, in the form of a “going concern”, but in my case i have been robbed of my "goodwill", with
slanderous false gossip, a pragmatic way of competing. The fallacy, that i am "homosexual", e.g. was widely spread.
Without a doubt it has to do with false gender theories doing the rounds, regarding the idea Truth. "Men must lie
and be corrupt to be men". </p>



<p>Normally goodwill, brand value etc, can be sold if a whole organisation is sold, or at least a division, which can
operate independently. I cannot do that, because a "pariah" has been made of me by "the-group". I have become an object
of utility to "the-group". An idea-generating machine in their minds, probably. Such a division of society between
those with human rights and those, who are "forced to be free", without human rights, make objects of humans. Modern
secular utilitarian constitutions include this division among humans, with the "human" right to impart ideas from
Socrates's "gods" and "goddesses" who have good ideas, recognized in the Eucharist/Mass. Organisations do not have
utility value, because organisations can not directly be sacrificed and praised for ideas, as done during Eucharist/Mass.
Good ideas always come from humans. Value of utility refers only to something consumers can use, for which the price
must be minimised, according to <em>Intequinism</em>. Slavery, with good reason, is against the law.</p>



<p>It is at the selling of a "going concern" where&nbsp;<em>IPPAEX</em>&nbsp;becomes relevant. When a&nbsp;<em>brandtoken</em>&nbsp;is
listed on&nbsp;<em>IPPAEX</em>, the difference-value (between "going concern" value and liquidation value) or part of it,
can be sold, without selling a "going concern" (whole organisation or an independent division). Selling a division as
"going concern", means breaking an organisation up or down, into more than one part(s).&nbsp;In order to hinder breaking
down an organisation by dividing it, <em>IPPAEX</em>&nbsp;can be used to raise funds by monetizing brand values, goodwill,
copyrights etc. If a&nbsp;<em>brandtoken</em>&nbsp;is listed, which represents a whole organisation, with all its divisions,
it means, if the whole organisation is sold in the future, the sale will be on the condition that the brand or goodwill,
sold in the form of a&nbsp;<em>brandtoken</em>, cannot be sold again. 48% of the Africahead brand value can therefore
never be sold again in another form than AFA. This was my intention with Africahead Ipparts (AFA).&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <em>fonetones</em> website, e.g. with all the ringtones, subjected to copyrights, are parts of the Africahead brand
and it contribute to the Africahead brand value. If i now, or the management of Africahead in the future, decides to sell
<em>fonetones, </em>it could affect the value of the Africahead brand positively or negatively. It could be argued, because
of that effect, caused by management of Africahead, holders of AFA should vote about such a sale. Not true; that is why AFA
represents only 48% of the brand value in total. Management of Africahead controls 52% of the total brand value, therefore
management can decide self to sell, e.g. <em>fonetones</em>, with 100% of the <em>fonetones</em> brand value, included in
the sale. That was my intention, seen retrospectively, when i wrote the White Paper for AFA. Africahead is thus the brand
mark at the top, carrying all the Intellectual Property value in Africahead, but management of Africahead can sell separate
identifiable parts, 100%. Obviously such transactions must be at maximum selling prices, to benefit the holders of AFA
maximally. It seems thus logically <em>Intequinism's</em> promotion of minimum prices, can only refer to royalties/prices;
that is, everyday revenues of e.g. sales of ringtones and books. If the <em>fonetones</em> website is sold e.g., a maximum
selling price must be negotiated, by Africahead's management, in order to respect holders of AFA, who want their investment
value maximised. The difference with a share of a listed stock exchange company is; AFA <em>ipparts</em>, do not give a right
to dividends. Shares represent maximum prices of utilities because dividends must be maximised. It is a flaw in the stock
exchange system because it hinders minimum prices for maximum utility to consumers. Logically thus, according to
<em>Intequinism</em>, the stock exchange system will come to an end. It can happen gradually, whilst investors move
their investments elsewhere to, for example, <em>IPPAEX</em>, where competition for maximum utility value is not hindered,
with maximum prices for products. Investments for retirement on <em>IPPAEX</em>, currently, is however too risky.</p>



<p>Although <em>Intequinism </em>aims to maximise utility value, <em>Intequinism</em> is not utilitarian philosophy,
because the "essence" of utilitarian systems, is the sacrificing of the "Other", stealing of 'intelligence', printing
of money, and lending/giving money to "brothers and sisters", who employ others, to develop stolen ideas.</p>



<p>Apart from the benefit, of capital being raised, on <em>IPPAEX</em>, another benefit is, the&nbsp;<em>brandtokens</em>&nbsp;can
be traded on&nbsp;<em>IPPAEX</em>. The holders of the tokens, can thus hold the tokens if they think the brand value will increase,
or they can sell the tokens if they think the tokens will decrease in value. There is thus a societal benefit, whereby the public,
judges an organisation listed on <em>IPPAEX</em>, for maximum utility value to society. If an organisation lists
a&nbsp;<em>brandtoken</em>, it subjects itself to opinions of the public, similar to a listed company on a stock exchange.
This raises a question. What will happen if Africahead decides e.g. to list a <em>brandtoken </em>for <em>fonetones</em>? It
could be a way for society to identify <em>fonetones</em> employees, subjecting them to societal opinion/trading of
<em>fonetones</em> <em>brandtokens</em>, but yet, keep the division within Africahead, for management purposes. Such
an issue will have to be done like a rights issue of shares to holders of AFA, because the fonetones value is currently
included in the AFA value. Hypothetically, if <em>fonetones</em> <em>brandtokens</em> are listed on <em>IPPAEX</em> the AFA
tokens' value should decrease with the new value of <em>fonetones brandtokens.</em></p>



<p>Valuation theories, for&nbsp;<em>brandtokens</em>&nbsp;are not the same as valuation theories for securities.
<em>Brandtokens</em> consist of countable units, called <em>ipparts</em> (intellectual property parts).&nbsp;The
most obvious reason <em>ipparts</em> are not valued like securities is, physical assets are not included in the
values of <em>ipparts</em>. <em>IPPAEX</em>, for example, has as foundation, the philosophy&nbsp;<em>Intequinism</em>.
According to&nbsp;<em>Intequinism,</em>&nbsp;minimum <em>IPPAEX</em> exchange fees will maximise the value of Africahead
Ipparts (AFA)&nbsp;<em>brandtokens</em>, because minimum costs, for the listing of other&nbsp;<em>brandtokens</em>, will
leave more cash in the bank accounts of organisations, listing&nbsp;<em>brandtokens,</em>&nbsp;and in the pockets of
buyers/sellers of&nbsp;<em>brandtokens</em>.</p>



<p>From this article it can be derived, unless i am now mistaken, that according to the logic of <em>Intequinism</em>,
minimum prices apply only to everyday selling prices, for everyday use/utility of products and services. When a part
of Africahead e.g. <em>fonetones</em> or the copyright on a book, or copyright on a ringtone/<em>fonetone</em> is
sold, maximum value must be negotiated for, because of AFA holders. It indicates something about utilitarian
philosophy, <em>Intequinism</em> is not. It implies own Intellectual Property does not have utility value, but
the representations, e.g. books thereof has, utility value. The value of own Intellectual Property must be
maximised, and the utility value of representations thereof, maximised, with minimum prices. The ability of
organisations and individuals to distribute utility, must currently be maximised, according
to <em>Intequinism</em>.</p>
