                <p>The value the market places on AFA, is a reflection of customers' appreciation of the brand. Therefore,
                equity:<em>intequity</em> owners and employees will not hold AFA. They determine the benefit customers get from using
                Africahead products and services. 25'000 AFA was made available for the ITO. Part of the authorised AFA is held in
                trust for future use. The total authorised AFA are 480'000 tokens. 455'000 AFA are held in trust. The balance of 25'000 AFA,
                not issued, are also held in trust, until issued.</p>
                
                <p>15 October 2018, the first AFA were sold. The sale triggered the cession mentioned in the
                   White Paper dated 12 October 2018. The White Paper of the said date is therefore the official
                   governing agreement among AFA holders, equity:<em>intequity</em> holders and Moiom CC transacting as
                    Africahead. 48% of the <a href="TheBrand.html" target="_blank">Africahead brand</a>

          <p><b>Initial Price per token:</b> 25 USD-value/AFA = 0.25 USD value per ippart.</p>
          <p><b>Current and Future issue prices:</b> The issue prices increase to give buyers who see
          the logic first, most benefit.</p>
          <p><b>Duration of ITO:</b> Until "the event" takes place. "The event" will be the issue of 25'000 AFA 
            or the instant when 500'000 USD value will have been raised, which ever happens first. If Africahead
             can raise 500'000 USD value whilst issuing less than 25'000 AFA, it will.</p>
          <p>Know your client (KYC) rules do not apply, because it cannot apply on Decentralized Exchange 
            Counters where AFA is sold. Knowing who buyers of AFA will sell to in the future is impossible.

          <h3>Africahead is not a developer of blockchain technology. Africahead uses the best available
               blockchain infrastructure available, to attain its goals.
            </h3>

          <p>How does the over the counter (OTC) sale work?  480'000 üåç¬†Africahead Ipparts (AFA) ERC20 tokens, which equal
             48‚Äô000‚Äô000 <em>ipparts</em>, were authorised and registered on the Ethereum network. Each AFA token has 2 decimal places.
             Each üåç¬†Africahead Ipparts (AFA)
                token consists of 100 <em>ipparts</em>.
              Tokens not issued are
                held in trust by Africahead to raise capital currently and in the future. During future Token
                Offerings the holders of AFA at that time will have options to buy newly issued AFA first.
                For the ITO, 25'000 tokens are available. When 500‚Äô000¬†USD value will have been raised or 25'000 AFA 
                issued, whichever happens first ("the event"), the
                 sale will close. The AFA white paper includes the commitment; future issues of AFA, after this initial offer, will be
                 done in a similar way than a rights offer on a stock exchange. That means holders of AFA at the time will get an option
                 to first buy AFA, according to the new issue, to protect them against dilution during future issues.
                </p>
                <p>Brand values are arbitrary. This sale will help to establish a market value for the Africahead
                 brand. At the time of "the event", the issued AFA will represent 48% of the <a href="TheBrand.html"
                 target="_blank">brand</a> value. Discounts will be considered for large
                  amounts. The remaining 52% of the brand value is not represented by AFA. It remains the property of equity
                  holders of Africahead.

                 of the law because the value of AFA is not correlated positively with, book value of equity, profits, interest, fixed assets
                 and debt,
                as is the case with ‚Äúsecurities‚Äù. Africahead may not borrow. Values representing the brand value of Africahead
                may not
                be capitalized on its balance sheet, without being sold, according to International Accounting Standards. Those
                assets, representing the brand, which may not be capitalized without selling it, back AFA. Comparing
                a listed company on a stock exchange, the relevant value, backing AFA, is the difference between net asset value
                (book value of equity) per its
                balance sheet, and market capitalization of issued/traded shares.</p>
                
                <p>Goodwill, copyrights (especially on the Africahead mark and <em>Intequinism</em>) and
                transacting mark values are the most important determinants of the value of the Africahead brand.
                An inverse relation exists between values of the brand and profit, Africahead makes out of customers.
                The less cash Africahead draws, from customers, for products and services, the more cash is left in the
                pockets of customers, and the more valuable the Africahead brand is. Mainstream capitalist economic theory
                teaches a positive correlation between profits and brand values exists. The theories use discounted dividends,
                to determine brand values, in calculations, but dividends are not relevant at AFA's new-capitalist token economics.</p>
