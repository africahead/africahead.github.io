            Bacchus, was originally a Thracian god. The Thracians were
            very much less civilized than the Greeks, who regarded them
            as barbarians. Like all primitive agriculturists, they had
            fertility cults, and a god who promoted fertility. His name
            was Bacchus. It was never quite clear whether Bacchus had
            the shape of a man or a bull. When they discovered how to
            make beer, they thought intoxication divine, and gave honour
            to Bacchus. When, later, they came to know the vine and to
            learn to drink wine, they thought even better of him. His
            function in promoting fertility in general became somewhat
            subordinate to his function in relation to the grape and the
            divine madness produced by wine." (Russel,&nbsp;2004:24)<o:p></o:p></span></big></big></p>

            concerned to advocate views that will make people what he
            thinks virtuous; he is hardly ever intellectually honest,

            discussion so as to lead to a virtuous result. He introduced
            this vice into philosophy, where it has persisted ever

    <p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><span lang="EN-US">"Let us begin with
            Xenophon, a military man, not very liberally endowed with
            brains, and on the whole conventional in his outlook.
            Xenophon is pained that Socrates should have been accused of
            impiety and of corrupting the youth; he contends that, on
            the contrary, Socrates was eminently pious and had a
            thoroughly wholesome effect on those who came under his
            influence. His ideas, it appears, so far from being
            subversive, were rather dull and commonplace. This defence
            goes to far, since it leaves the hostility to Socrates
            unexplained." (</span><span style="font-family:Times"

    <big><big> </big></big>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><span lang="EN-US">"There has been a
            tendency to think that everything Xenophon says must be
            true, because he had not the wits to think of anything
            untrue. This is a very invalid line of argument. A stupid
            man's report of what a clever man says is never accurate,
            because he unconsciously translates what he hears into
            something that he can understand. I would rather be reported
            by my bitterest enemy among philosophers than by a friend
            innocent of philosophy." (</span><span

    <big><big> </big></big>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><span lang="EN-US">"Nevertheless,
            some of Xenophon's reminiscences are very convincing. He
            tells (as Plato also does) how Socrates was continually
            occupied with the problem of getting competent men into
            positions of power. He would ask such questions as: 'If I
            wanted a shoe mended, whom should I employ?' To which some
            ingenuous youth would answer: 'A shoemaker, O Socrates.' He
            would go on to carpenters, coppersmiths, etc., and finally
            ask some such question as 'who should mend the Ship of
            State?' When he fell into conflict with the Thirty Tyrants,
            Critias, their chief, who knew his ways from having studied
            under him, forbade him to continue teaching the young, and
            added: 'You had better be done with shoemakers, carpenters
            and coppersmiths. These must be pretty well trodden out at
            heel by this time, considering the circulation you have
            given them' (Xenophon,&nbsp;<i
              style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Memorabilia</i>,&nbsp;Bk.&nbsp;I,&nbsp;chap.&nbsp;ii)."

    <p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><span lang="EN-US">"With Plato's
            account of Socrates, the difficulty is quite a different one
            from what it is in the case of Xenophon, namely, that it is
            very hard to judge how far Plato means to portray the
            historical Socrates, and how far he intends the person
            called 'Socrates' in his dialogues to be merely the
            mouthpiece of his own opinions. Plato, in addition to being
            a philosopher, is an imaginative writer of great genius and
            charm. No one suppposes, and he himself does not seriously
            pretend, that the conversations in his dialogue took place

            Socrates's real friends and real enemies
            (Plato,&nbsp;2013:634). Was the alternative sentence, of 30
            minae, Socrates suggested a sarcastic reference to "the
            Thirty" tyrants, which perhaps included Aristotle. Today i

            man towards the non-human environment has differed
            profoundly at different times. The Greeks, with their dread
            of hubris and their belief in a Necessity or Fate superior
            even to Zeus, carefully avoided what would have seemed to
            them insolence towards the universe. The Middle Ages carried
            submission much further: humility towards God was a
            Christian's first duty. Initiative was cramped by this
            attitude, and great originality was scarcely possible. The
            Renaissance restored human pride, but carried it to the
            point where it led to anarchy and disaster. Its work was
            largely undone by the Reformation and the
            Counter-reformation. But modern technique, while not
            altogether favourable to the lordly individual of the
            Renaissance, has revived the sense of the collective power
            of human communities. Man, formerly too humble, begins to
            think of himself as almost a God. The Italian pragmatist
            Papini urges us to substitute the 'Imitation of God' for the
            'Imitation of Christ'.<o:p></o:p></span></big></big></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><span lang="EN-US">In all this I feel
            a grave danger, the danger of what might be called cosmic
            impiety. The concept of 'truth' as something dependent upon
            facts largely outside human control has been one of the ways
            in which philosophy hitherto has inculcated the necessary
            element of humility. When this check upon pride is removed,
            a further step is taken on the road towards a certain kind
            of madness—the intoxication of power which invaded
            philosophy with Fichte, and to which modern men, whether
            philosophers or not, are prone. I am persuaded that this
            intoxication is the greatest danger of our time, and that
            any philosophy which, however unintentionally, contributes
            to it is increasing the danger of vast social disaster."

            conflicting fanaticism, one of the few unifying forces is
            scientific truthfulness, by which I mean the habit of basing

            and as much divested of local and temperamental bias, as is
            possible for human beings." (Russell,&nbsp;2004:743-744)</span><span
