          lang="EN-GB">"Men made clothes for thousands of years, under
          the compulsion of the need for clothing, without a single man
          becoming a tailor. But the existence of coats, of linen, of
          every element of material wealth not provided in advance by
          nature, had always to be mediated through a specific
          productive activity appropriate to its purpose, a productive
          activity that assimilated particular natural materials to
          particular human requirements. <b
            style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Labour, then, as the
            creator</b> [own bold] of use values, as useful labour, is a

            style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">independent of all
            forms of society </b>[own bold]; it is an eternal natural
          necessity which mediates the metabolism between man and

          lang="EN-GB">It seems Marx did not consider ideas as valuable,
          maybe because during his time labour was not remunerated
          fairly. He was possibly arguing for the most immediately
          logical solution for underpaid workers. Up to p. 133 of the
          book it seems as if the communist belief that all labour hours
          have the same value, could have originated partly from Marx.
          Did he see idea generation as an opposing force by
          capitalists?<o:p></o:p></span></big></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:Arial"
          lang="EN-GB">Marx excluded qualitative aspects of labour and
          education from his calculation of "the value of a commodity"
          on this page (Marx 1990:135). "<i
            style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Simple average labour</i>,
          it is true, varies in character in different countries and at
          different cultural epochs, but in a particular society it is
          given. More complex labour counts only as intensified, or
          rather multiplied simple labour, so that a smaller quantity of
          complex labour is considered equal to a larger amount of
          simple labour. Experience shows that this reduction is
          constantly being made. A commodity may be the outcome of the
          most complicated labour, but through its value it is posited
          as equal to the product of simple labour, hence it represents
          only a specific quantity of simple labour." (Marx 1990:135)
          "In general, the greater the productivity of labour, the less
          the labour time required to produce an article, the less the
          mass of labour crystalized in that article, and the less its
          value. Inversely, the less the productivity of labour, the
          greater the labour-time necessary to produce an article, and
          the greater its value." (Marx 1990:133). The contradiction
          between pp. 133 and 135 is caused by Marx's idea of "In
          general", which he did "In the interest of simplification"
          (Marx 1990:135).<o:p></o:p></span></big></p>

          of commodities through their price. Hence a thing can,
          formally speaking, have a price without having a value." (Marx

          starting-point of capital. The production of commodities and
          their circulation in its developed form, namely trade, form
          the historic presuppositions under which capital arises. World
          trade and the world market date from the sixteenth century,
          and from then on the modern history of capital starts to
          unfold." (Marx 1990:247) This is obviously false because after
          ideas originate, then the capital is raised to develop those
          ideas. Money/Capital is then used to pay salaries during the
          development process of commodities. Especially when new money
          is printed and forwarded, for example at the OECD countries.
          The quantitative easing, which took place, recently after the
          2008 financial crisis however were mostly used to refinance
          banks. The capital was thus created, which gave banks new
          capital to issue development capital. It would be interesting
          to see where all the quantitative easing capital entered the
          system.<o:p></o:p></span></big></p>

          Bekker, lib. I, c. 8,9, passim. Works of Aristotle, Vol X,
          Oxford, 1921 'Politica', trs. B. Jowett, paras. 1256 and
          1257). He explains that Aristotle distinguished between
          barter, which is a "means to an end" and "chrematistics".
          Chrematistics is an "end in itself" with unlimited
          possibility. Chrematistics is not exchanging in the sense of
          bartering to get hold of a commodity for self-use. Money made
          chrematistics possible; that is pursuing maximum profit
          without limit, via buying and selling. (Marx 1990: 252-254)<br>

    <p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:Arial"
          lang="EN-GB">"Hence Aristotle says: 'Since chrematistics is a
          double science, one part belonging to commerce, the other to
          economics, the latter being necessary and praiseworthy, the
          former based on circulation and with justice disapproved (for
          it is not based on Nature, but on mutual cheating), the usurer
          is most rightly hated, because money itself is the source of
          his gain, and is not used for the purposes for which it was
          invented.' Aristotle, op cit. c. 10 [English translation,
          para. 1258b]" (Marx 1990:267)<o:p></o:p></span></big></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:Arial"
          lang="EN-GB">"We have seen that the means of production
          transfer value to the new product only when during the labour
          process they lose value in the shape of their old use-value.
          The maximum loss of value the means of production can suffer
          in the process is plainly limited by the amount of the
          original value with which they entered into it, or, in other
          words, by the labour-time required to produce them. Therefore
          the means of production can never add more value to the
          product than they themselves possess independently of the
          process in which they assist." (Marx 1990:313-314) Marx
          excluded profit from the value added. The purchase price of
          the means was not considered. "Means" mean machines etc, not
          direct labour. Up to now in the book i have not seen anything
          that shows that Marx valued ideas. He did however analyse
          profit, which is "surplus-value" in his words (Marx 1990:324).
          Marx wrote that "surplus-value" originates from working longer
          working hours than necessary, to supply self with the
          necessary things to live. He wrote that it takes, fore example
          6 hours per day to supply self with necessities. If a worker
          thus works 12 hours, the additional 6 hours accumulate into
          the selling value of the commodities of a producer/capitalist
          (Marx 1990:324-325). Marx ascribed profit only to a difference
          between necessary labour hours and necessary+surplus labour
          hours without considering effects ideas have on the time of
          necessary labour hours and consequentially on profit (Marx
          1990:327-328).<o:p></o:p></span></big></p>

          entirely brought about by the capital that employs them. Their
          unification into one single productive body, and the
          establishment of a connection between their individual
          functions, lies outside their competence. These things are not
          their own act, but the act of the capital that brings them
          together and maintains them in that situation. Hence the
          interconnection between their various labours confronts them,
          in the realm of ideas, as a plan drawn up by a capitalist,
          and, in practice, as his authority, as the powerful will of a
          being outside them, who subjects their activity to his
          purpose. If capitalist direction is thus twofold in content,
          owing to the twofold nature of the process of production which
          has to be directed - on the one hand a social labour process
          for the creation of a product, and on the other hand capital's
          process of valorization - in form it is purely despotic."

          lang="EN-GB">Marx explains a difference between production at
          old Indian rural societies and capitalist manufacturers. He
          wrote that at the Indian communities the system was static and
          all the land was held in community of property. Nobody was
          allowed to employ people in the Indian system because the
          community allocated the produce to, for example, a potter. In
          the capitalist system, capitalists have access to capital and
          land and can employ people. Traders, like others in the Indian
          system were not allowed to employ people and own land. Their
          power was thus limited. In India the people were however still
          controlled (influenced), it seems, from Marx writing,
          centrally, by, the 'elders' of a community, for example
          Brahmins etc. In India dynasties changed but the social
          structure of the 'communist' communities stayed static. At
          capitalism workers often don't have skills to make a whole
          product. They make parts of products and therefore their
          skills make them immobile and more subservient to their
          employer and potential employers. (Marx 1990:477-482)<o:p></o:p></span></big></p>

          lang="EN-GB">One big difference between the two systems is the
          influence of new ideas. In the capitalist system new ideas are
          much more likely to develop because of many capitalists who
          can decide on courses of action to develop ideas. In the
          Indian "communist" system there was much less freedom to
          innovate, but on the other hand, according to Marx, people
          could not be employed by capitalists and was freer in that
          sense.<o:p></o:p></span></big></p>

          lang="EN-GB">Marx was thus in favour of thinking and he
          identified the same problem, which Pienaar identified. The
          problem is that thinking is not motivated enough. The
          Communist system however, had the opposite effect of what Marx
          partly promoted. It seems Marx's solution or, solutions from
          how his work was interpreted, did not solve the problem he
          identified. Pienaar opines the reason was that Communism made
          ideas more commonly owned. Communists, for example abolished
          the church's patens; what did they do with patents? With
          Capitalism, although the availability of capital to develop
          ideas, is skewed, development happened more efficiently than
          at Communism. Pienaar's proposed solutions is thus to the
          opposite side of Communism's, according to his current
          knowledge. Currently, with Capitalism, ideas are appropriated
          and developed, benefitting a small part of society
          financially. Benefits, often, do not settle 'at all', at 'the'
          generators of ideas and therefore idea generations are not
          motivated. At Communism, it seems, benefits of idea
          generations were even further removed from generators, because
          ideas were regarded more socially Mind like than at
          Capitalism.<o:p></o:p></span></big></p>

          wrote negatively about "inventors", Marx, here, said
          capitalists did not value the work of scientists. Pienaar
          understands what he means, but Marx's meaning is contradicting
          because on the one hand he writes negatively about innovation
          but on the other hand, he criticizes capitalism because
          capitalists do not ascribe value to science/ideas.
          Inventors/scientists also have living expenses, which must be
          financed. The scientific applications, which use nature he
          wrote about, did not fall out of the air, and new inventions,
          which are or should be financed, take place continuously. It
          is this view of Marx, also prevalent at some capitalists,
          which partly caused "the stranger" of Kearney, "the other",
          "the individual" of the humanities. Coletto, with his
          philosophy against progress, is a good example of current
          views, which are similar to part of Marx's views. Marx blamed
          capitalists for joblessness. Capitalist politicians still
          place much attention on job creation although jobs are
          becoming less, due to innovation. The current Davos congress
          in Switzerland promotes a "4th Industrial Revolution" with
          artificial intelligence, whilst capitalist politicians do not
          acknowledge the impact on job opportunities. Marx should have
          criticized the politicians more than "inventors" because the
          politicians did not keep track with innovation through their
          policies. There can never be enough 'jobs' (current definition
          of 'job') for everybody except, in an apocalyptic
          eschatological view where catastrophes balance population
          numbers with job opportunities. Marx promoted revolution by
          force in line with apocalyptic views and he promoted a world
          in which a man can fish and hunt on the same day, similar to
          ancient societies. Politicians should rather make available,
          food, accommodation, sports and arts facilities, etc. to the
          unemployed, for them to have a dignified life. Some people,
          with sports and arts, these days, contribute much to GDPs.
          Dignity should not be coupled 'solely' with being 'employed'.
          Dignity brings population growths down. Modern Western
          countries showed this. It can also be argued that there was
          more 'dignity' amongst old American Indian societies and
          African societies, before colonization, than after, resulting
          in sustainable population growths and therefore the imbalance
          between subsistence and population numbers was not then such a
          big problem. Dignity, perhaps comes thus before sustainable
          population growths.<o:p></o:p></span></big></p>

          lang="EN-GB">Ideas can be common property in reality, if
          everyone has dignity via financial security, and dignity
          according to their abilities, because, then there are no needs
          to get financial security from ideas. If a group of people are
          working together and they all have financial security and
          dignity, according to their means, they can freely share ideas
          and work together on the development of those ideas. If some
          of the group are excluded from financial security and dignity
          and an excluded generates a good idea he/she might not share
          in the desserts following the idea. The desserts are the
          financial security and the dignity the idea will bring.
          Therefore, he/she can withhold the idea from the group. It
          seems thus that in a community where everyone has dignity and
          financial security, ideas will flow more freely. Problems
          however occur if people each want to be seen as a generator of
          good ideas, even if they aren't. If an idea wasn't, "it was my
          idea", they each can claim. Then deceivers can portray
          themselves as generators of ideas, which they appropriated
          from others, which will inhibit free flow of ideas. On the
          other hand, in a community with dignity and financial
          security, maybe, ideas will not be forthcoming, because of the
          financial security and dignity. Maybe that is what happened in
          pre-colonial America and Africa and that is why science did
          not progress there. This view however, Pienaar doubts because
          much innovation took place by people with financial security
          and dignity in the past, for example in Europe. It could also
          be that in pre-colonial America and Africa there was not
          enough correspondence to reality to cause scientific
          inventions.<o:p></o:p></span></big></p>

          lang="EN-GB">Whilst Marx explained his opinion about how
          capital form after an investment of £10,000 and a production
          process, which caused profit of £2,000, he wrote: "The
          original capital was formed by the advance of £10,000. Where
          did its owner get it from? 'From his own labour and that of
          his forefathers', is the unanimous answer of the spokesmen of
          political economy. And, in fact, their assumption appears to
          be the only one consonant with the laws of commodity
          production. But it is quite otherwise with regard to the
          additional capital of £2,000. We know perfectly well how that
          originated. There is not one single atom of its value that
          does not owe its existence to unpaid labour." (Marx 1990:728)
          Marx clearly did not consider the value of ideas and not even
          the value of networking here. An idea and a network of the
          capitalist, employing the labour could have contributed
          substantially to the £ 2 000.<o:p></o:p></span></big></p>

          This, in passing into its new shape, incorporates, free of

          knowledge as represented by technologically advanced machinery
          and methods. His view of capitalist ends is thus a return to a
          feudalistic type of environment in which kings of territories

          set in motion a larger quantity of machinery and raw material.
          The absolute reduction in the demand for labour which
          necessarily follows from this is obviously so much the

          view for example "Christianity" and "Mohammedanism". (Hitler
          1939:13) It thus relates to the tension between nominalism and
          realism. Hitler's totalitarianism and his disrespect for
          non-nationalist views is clearly visible in the book. Hitler
          often refers to honesty in a positive way and wrote that Jews
          in a group sense deceive, but the question remains so far
          whether the honesty he writes about is understood in a
          nominalist sense or a sense of realism, which allows
          nominalist subjective deceits, in order to keep his
          totalitarian outlook in place. Up to page 150 he has not
          addressed this question. It seems, so far, that he did not
          realise no one can ever perceive the whole of the world as a
          datum. Individuals like him are dangerous if they gather
          support. On the other hand groups can also be dangerous and in
          effect "Hitler" became a group. Maybe it is how nature works;
          different dangerous groups eventually wipe each other out, and
          other people carry on.<br>

          1939:153) In my understanding of these words it is a
          contradiction because "negative destruction" is attacking and

          he valued individualism of "individuals" but the idea of the
          one and only, which was propagated by Platonic philosophy
          about essence, devalues his valuing of individuals in the
          plural. The two ideas are contradicting, because existence of
          a one and only devalues existence of each individual who is
          not a one and only. An idea, which fit together with another
          idea support the other idea, it does not devalue the other
          idea. Truth and love (social contract theory) are two ideas,
          which work together, without degrading the other of the two
          ideas. Valid social contract theory will promote protection of

          that on page 320 he seems to place ideas of his one and only

          is highest. What if a person or persons of another race than
          Aryans, apply Hitler's ideas better than Aryans? What is
          therefore Hitler's priority? Is it ideas or race? It seems it
          was the idea about a supreme race. I guess Hitler would have
          said that no other race would be able to apply the ideas he
          was promulgating. Hitler thought about essence. If he did not
          think about an essence maybe he would not have contradicted
          himself. I guess i made the mistake as well before i realized
          truth needs at least one other idea, love (not breaking the

          truth, can function on its own properly. <o:p></o:p></span></big></p>

          the state of war cannot arise from mere personal relations,
          but only from property relations." (Rousseau 1968:55) Did he
          have the war of Troy in mind, with regard to Helen when he

          group of people who combines their powers in a single "body
          politic". According to Rousseau their power is ultimate power
          without any constraint. (Rousseau 1968:64) If a member thus
          decides to not do what the group decide such a member "shall
          be forced to be free". (Rousseau 1968:64) The problem with
          Rousseau's theory is that he posits the power of the "body
          politic" ultimate without restraint. They can thus sacrifice
          persons outside of the group for their own gain or do
          something illegal together. If a member decides to not go
          along then he/she can be excommunicated, whilst being within
          'the law', of having certain ideas like Truth and universal
          Love above all, including the sovereign. The crux is thus
          whether sovereignty is above good ideas or, good ideas above

          only an aristocracy or democracy, but generally any government
          directed by the general will, which is law. If it is to be
          legitimate, the government must not be united with the
          sovereign, but must serve it as its ministry. So even a
          monarchy can be a republic" (Rousseau 1968:82)<o:p></o:p></span></big></p>
    <big> </big>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:Arial"
          lang="EN-GB">Rousseau distinguished between "law", which is
          universal and for example, decrees, which are not universal.
          The "general will" of the body politic, served by the
          government, is thus identified with universal laws, which are
          good for every member of the sovereign (body politic). But how
          is this "general will" determined? Primarily by a "lawgiver"
          who writes a constitution and who acts via "Gods"; Such
          lawgivers are usually not part of the body-politic, for
          example Greek lawgivers who wrote constitutions for republics.
          (Rousseau 1968:80-91) "Gods would be needed to give men laws."
          (Rousseau 1968:84) Elsewhere Rousseau wrote that if the
          body-politic do not complain, it is implied that the general
          will accept something. This means only mass action can revert
          a non-universal law. Also, a necessary consideration is, who
          exactly is this body politic? Is "a general will" not pie in
          the sky today? Rousseau appreciated the old types of
          governments of small republics where all the people came
          together with assemblies and discussed the issues of the time,
          whilst also making laws. He wrote that monarchies suit large
          republics and that there has never been a good king.<o:p></o:p></span></big></p>
    <big> </big>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:Arial"
          lang="EN-GB">Rousseau wrote the highest and most important
          law, not written down, which keeps the other laws in place
          relates to, "above all, belief: this feature, unknown to our
          political theorists, is the one on which the success of all
          the other laws depends; it is the feature on which the great
          lawgiver bestows his secret care, for though he seems to
          confine himself to detailed legal enactments, which are really
          only the arching of the vault, he knows that morals, which
          develop more slowly, ultimately become its immovable
          keystone." (Rousseau 1968:99)<o:p></o:p></span></big></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:Arial"

          collective and artificial person, unified by the force of the
          law and acting as trustee of executive power in the state."
          (Rousseau 1968:116) Rousseau used metaphors, and mixed
          singular and plural, which make it very difficult to determine
          what he meant. Although he refers to elections, "a method
          which makes honesty, sagacity, experience and all the other
          grounds of popular preference and esteem further guarantees of
          wise government" (Rousseau 1968:115), with regard to
          aristocracy, his use of metaphors and mixing of singular and
          plural, seem to have made his views incoherent. There is
          however one definition he uses consistently and that is that
          all the people of a state are "the sovereign" together.<o:p></o:p></span></big></p>
    <big> </big>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:Arial"

          "handbook for republicans". (Rousseau 1968:118) It is not
          certain whether Rousseau subscribed to the methods, promoted
          by Machiavelli in the book.<o:p></o:p></span></big></p>

          increases, the more the constitution changes for the worse,
          and, as in this case there is no distinct corporate will to
          resist the will of the prince and so to balance it, sooner or
          later it is inevitable that the prince will oppress the
          sovereign and break the social treaty." (Rousseau 1968:131) I

          Consult your own happiness with as little prejudice as you can

          much. Being pitied is degrading and those who put others in
          situations where they then pity the others get pleasure from
          feeling pity, because feeling pity sometimes makes them feel
