              production in South Africa. ‘The field of entrepreneurship
              in South Africa has certain unique although limiting
              characteristics, including an unconvincing enabling
              environment, a weak entrepreneurial culture and an
              emergent, and therefore limited, body of knowledge
              surrounding the topic of entrepreneurship. Consequently,
              entrepreneurship in South Africa does not hold a strong
              position in terms of entrepreneurial activity and, in
              fact, is generally approached with a degree of scepticism.
              At the same time, Maas (GEM) (Maas &amp; Herrington 2006:
              12) indicate categorically that an increase in
              entrepreneurial activity is highly dependent on effective
              entrepreneurship education. This study confirmed the fact
              that education <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">per

              entrepreneurship, is reality in South Africa, but markets
              are not free and free competition does not exist. Free
              markets are a prerequisite for entrepreneurship to be
              effective because entrepreneurial opportunities exist
              because entrepreneurs supply better value for money
              products and services than the ones before. If this
              possibility does not exist it excludes the entrepreneurial
              idea in reality. ‘The search for “truth’(sic) or “truthful

              cope better with the challenges and demands of each day (a
              very pragmatic interest), the aim of science is to
              generate truthful (valid and reliable) descriptions, model

              this as the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">epistemic

              and the legality of ownership of IP is developing. Law
              practitioners have varying opinions about the nature of

              operate are not clear. Securing financial gain from the
              generation of ideas is problematic and uncertain.
              Availability of capital for development during the early
              stage of ideas is very scarce. This situation exists while
              new capital is generated world-wide to develop ideas. This
              capital funds the living expenses of many people as
              payment for development work done by them. It often
              happens that good ideas are not used, shortly after it was
              generated because of a lack of knowledge and/or capital.
              The ideas are then sometimes lost to other countries.
              Although ideas are significant in a successful economy,
              currently idea generation does not receive due credit and
              people are not compensated for ideas even though the ideas
              contribute to wide welfare. The generators of ideas are
              often not included in the development process. How often
              do you hear the statements ‘It is only an idea’ or
              ‘Everybody has ideas’. This situation leads to a

              ideas, from the idea generation phase until after the
              proof-of-idea phase. I will call it the Info Stage. Most
              venture capital financing takes place after the
              proof-of-idea period. In the current Information Age it is
              crucial to have the necessary information and knowledge to
              ethically and successfully make funding decisions. The
              Info Stage of a project is one of the most important
              phases, because, it is during this phase, which the
              information is gathered, which determines, whether an
              investment should be made to further an idea. The length
              of the period, during which information is gathered, and
              the ownership of the IP, following the idea, lost or
              established, is influenced a lot with capital. Capital
              influences research and the availability of natural
              resources and labour. If no capital is used during the
              Info Stage, an idea is filtered by people’s discussions in
              general. The information becomes scattered amongst many
              people in such a case. It is a lengthy uncompetitive
              process and ownership of IP, following the idea, is lost
              when no capital or proactive action influences the Info
              Stage. Small and Medium Enterprises and creative people,
              often, do not have the capital to finance research during
              the Info Stage of their ideas.<o:p></o:p></span></big></big></p>

              responsibilities which parties have due to their
              involvement in the economy. It refers first and foremost
              to a party’s citizenship of a country in current law. IP
              and particularly the development of ideas is a grey
              developing area in which corporate citizens have to use
              constraint not to abuse powerful positions to the
              disadvantage of other citizens. This is a consequence of
              the problem which is created by global groups which
              operate over borders. If a foreign company employs local
              citizens, the ideas which were generated by the citizens
              and which are owned by the foreign company can be used
              legally to disenfranchise the fellow citizens of the
              country. If exorbitant prices are asked for the products,
              legally, it can have a negative influence on the people of
              the country. If a local citizen is involved with practices
              which disadvantage the other local citizens because he is
              responsible to the owners of the foreign company due to
              his employment, there is a Rubicon line which can be
              crossed. If this line is crossed treason can be involved
              because of a citizen’s first and foremost responsibility
              to his fellow citizens according to current nationalistic
              law principles. Corporate responsibility therefore creates
              a paradoxical situation of uncertain citizenship in some
              circumstances. It is ironic but in some cases empires were
              built as a result of favoring foreign connections to local
              ones. ‘Countries such as the UK, France, China and the
              Netherlands, which have had empires in the past, may still
              be enjoying the benefits of decades or centuries of busy
              cultural, political, social and commercial transactions
              with far-flung countries, even if the unpleasant military
              and political details are long consigned to the history

              be compensated. Christianity portrays honesty as a
              singular godly attribute and therefore many shun it in
              favour of disinformation and an easier short term route.
              Some people then sin or deceive deliberately because they
              think the sin will free them from this godthought which is
              portrayed in Christianity. The thought culminates at
              Revelation 19:11. The fear which is caused by the religion
              leads to an uncompetitive economy because creativity is
              discouraged and lost because deceit leads to illogical
              thoughts, which are not based on reality but rather on
              thoughts and memory to conceal. It also leads to a
              digression of people and society in general. Communication
              then digresses to a stage where information is not
              effectively transferred. Most people want to be informed
              investors. The transfer of meaningful information is
              central to communication. Most of us want to base our
              investment decisions on truth and reality or in other
              words on what actually happens. To lead with
              disinformation gives an advantage but the longer term
              result of deceit is the loss of logic abilities and
              creativity because capacity is used for storage of
              disinformation, which under truthful circumstances would
              not have been necessary to store. There is a time
              difference between actual order and logical order of
              events. The reason of this difference can be partly
              explained by the results of disinformation, which changes
              the timeframe in which logical sequences take place. Lies
              bend time. People who try to stay honest are logically
              capable of generating most useful ideas, because their
              brains are not storing memories of unreal events, they
              made up, which they want to remember. These people
              sometimes do not mix in the circles where capital is
              available to develop ideas and they do not normally
              develop the ideas they generated. The consequence is that
              many originators of ideas do not share sufficiently in the
              benefits the ideas bring forth. I say sufficiently because
              the income some of them receive is not sufficient to
              motivate creative behavior in the commercial world in
              South Africa. People are then, depending on their makeup,
              forced to take other routes to survive and put food on the
              table, with a consequential loss of creative abilities in
              the commercial world and with a consequential weakening of
              South Africa’s competence in the global economy. To stay
              honest is difficult because of pressures by society to be
              dishonest in order to make a living.<o:p></o:p></span></big></big></p>

              countries, which they have to purchase. To be able to
              purchase the technology they need to borrow foreign

              lang="EN-US">“Dr. Betty Dong, a medical researcher at the
              University of California at San Francisco (UCSF), compared
              a brand-name drug with brand-name money. Dong was the
              director of a study sponsored by the British
              pharmaceutical company Boots (now called Knoll) and UCSF.
              The fate of that partnership does much to illuminate
              precisely how the mandate of universities as sites for
              public-interest research is often squarely at odds with
              the interests of branded fact-finding missions. Dr. Dong’s
              study compared the effectiveness of Boots’ thyroid drug,
              Synthroid, with a generic competitor. The company hoped
              that the research would prove that its much higher priced
              drug was better or at least substantially different from
              the generic one – a claim that if legitimized by a study
              from a respected university, would increase Synthroid
              sales. Instead, Dr. Dong found that the opposite was true.
              The two drugs were bio-equivalent, a fact that represented
              a potential saving of $365 million a year for the eight
              million Americans who were taking the name-brand drug and
              a potential loss to Boots of $ 600 million (the revenue
              from Synthroid). After the results were reviewed by her
              peers, Dr. Dong’s findings were slated to be published in
              the Journal of the American Medical Association on January
              25, 1995. At the last minute, however, Boots successfully
              halted publication of the article, pointing to a clause in
              the partnership contract that gave the company veto rights
              over the publication of findings.” Later it was exposed in
              The Wall Street Journal and the paper was published in
              April 1997 two years behind schedule. Two other cases are
              mentioned in Naomi Kleins’ book. “The only element out of
              the ordinary in these three cases od stifled research is
              that they involved academics with the personal integrity
              and the dogged tenacity to publicly challenge their
              corporate “partners” and their own employers – factors
              that eventually led to the truth coming out through the
              press.”…..”According to a 1994 study conducted on industry
              research partnerships at U.S. universities, most corporate
              interference occurs quietly and with no protest. The study
              found that companies maintained the right to block the
              publication of findings in 35 percent of cases, while 53
              percent of the academics surveyed agreed that ‘publication
              can be delayed’”........”Why have university professors
              remained silent, passively allowing their corporate
              “partners” to trample the principles of freedom of inquiry
              and discourse that have been the avowed centerpieces of
              academic life? </span><span

              that the idea is the less important is disputable. One
              could argue that the idea was the more important of the
              two because without the idea there would not be any
              utilities. Generating the idea is also an important
              attribute which distinguish humans from animals. Animals
              do not have hands. If humans did not have hands and could
              not communicate understandably it would have been much
              more difficult to implement ideas.<span
                style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Human
              development is dependant on hands and idea generating
              minds and both should be compensated. In a competitive
              economy compensation will determine what is done according
              to Locke’s labor proviso. Without compensation for idea
              creation the economy will not be competitive. If the idea
              did not originate, the hands would not have had anything
              to do. Therefore, generating the idea, adds significant
              value because it creates work and helps to create
              utilities. The idea generating mind and the hands do not
              have to be part of the same human being. The handwork
              creates only the utility with not as much work being
              created by the handwork. During the handwork new ideas are
              generated but these ideas are mostly “obvious” and does
              not add unique value. To generate novel ideas and obvious
              ideas are not as common as handwork because of the honesty
              factor. The more honest persons are, the more likely they
              are to create ideas, because of logic, which is a result
              of honesty. The more people are dishonest, the more
              difficult it is to stay honest for people who want to be
              honest. To stay honest is difficult and therefore creating
              the idea because of persevering with honesty falls under
              Locke’s labour proviso which says compensation is
              warranted because of the unpleasantness of labour. To stay
              honest is an unpleasant labour of the mind. Without the
              idea, there would be no utility, therefore the
              “value-added” proviso is also fulfilled which warrants
              compensation for generating ideas. The idea generator
              often is an individualist and the handworkers are often a
              group. Between the idea generator and the handwork group
              there is the group who possess most of the Intellectual
              Property. The possessors also control most that is
              happening, with special reference to the level of
              compensation of the idea generator and the handwork group.
              Obviously the possessors think they have abundant
              financial security. Financial security is a factor which
              many idea generators and handworkers strife to, in order
              to increase their standard of living and expected
              perceived dignified retirement.<o:p></o:p></span></big></big></p>

              Roman&quot;" lang="EN-US"> I agree fully that compensation
              is one of the most important issues which need change with
              regard to IP issues. The reason is that the current system
              encourages people to become dishonest because we are not
              compensated for IP created. A big part of IP is controlled
              by secrecy and the common law. Most secrets are open for
              misuse because it is not subjected to the scrutiny of
              society. If secrets are open for society it becomes
              possible to misappropriate it. It depends therefore on the
              people who are involved and their morals and not on the
              system. Currently the system causes immorality because
              creation is not sufficiently compensated. Creation has to
              be sufficiently compensated in order for morality to
              flourish. If it is overcompensated immorality can set in,
              which is often the case if a person does not control new
              riches within societal boundaries. What came first the
              chicken or the egg? What came first, the new system or the
              new morals? New morals which are accepted generate a new
              change of a system. This could imply that the chicken came
              before the egg and that the egg is the method which
              spreads chickens over earth. Evolutionary changes could
              cause a flying bird from a chicken’s egg. This flying bird
              would then lay eggs which will spread the new specie over
              earth.<o:p></o:p></span></big></big></p>

              Hettinger’s and Lynn Sharpe Paine’s essays the clear
              distinction between copyright protection and patent
              protection on the one side and trade secret law on the
              other side comes forth. Copyright and patent protection
              encourages the disclosure of information which is
              protected for a fixed period and trade secret law
              penalises the disclosure of information. If information is
              disclosed the protection can be foregone under some
              circumstances under trade secret law. Trade secret law is
              grounded in common acceptable morals generally seen, as
              for the general good of society. Ideas are seen as IP of
              the creator under trade secret law and therefore to be
              communicated to others as the creator sees fit. If ideas
              are lost due to espionage or other immoral practices which
              infringe on the rights of individuals it is unacceptable
              and remedies exist in trade secret law. It seems that in
              the USA, IP law are enforced by the government and seen in
              a criminal sense. In South Africa it is not the case and
              IP law is only enforceable through civil actions. It is
              perhaps the most relevant factor which makes IP law of
              negligible use to an individual with limited financial
              resources in South Africa.<br>

              and, at one point, a thousand fold. The point is that the
              value produced by labor is a far greater source of
              inequality than any slight discrepancies in size of
              original appropriation. If you appropriate two acres while
              I appropriate only one and we both leave our land
              unimproved, you have twice what I do. But, if I get
              maximum value out of my land by great industry and
              application of reason, I might end up with five hundred

              amount of property. Locke, however, makes clear that he is
              totally indifferent to even such radical disparities in

              creativity as a result of a moral attribute, honesty,
              which is difficult to uphold and should therefore be
              compensated fairly in a sustainable society. It is however
              relevant how the information to improve the value was
              attained. If it was attained by spying and breaking the
              law the ownership is questionable and the moral
              justification does not exist according to trade secret
              law. Locke must have included creative thought or another
              legal method of acquiring knowledge as a means to increase
              the value in his reasoning because it is unlikely to
              increase the value of land 500 fold with physical labor on
              one’s own, especially without capital. With sufficient
              capital the creative labor could be employed. When
              Intellectual Property becomes relevant and correct
              Intellectual Property rights are enforced the issue about
              land becomes less relevant because by being ethically
              honest, intellectual property or intequity will be

              encourages people to become dishonest because we are not
              compensated for IP created. A big part of IP is controlled
              by secrecy and the common law. Most secrets are open for
              misuse because it is not subjected to the scrutiny of
              society. If secrets are open for society it becomes
              possible to misappropriate it. It depends therefore on the
              people who are involved and their morals and not on the
              system. Currently the system causes immorality because
              creation is not sufficiently compensated. Creation has to
              be sufficiently compensated in order for morality to
              flourish. If it is overcompensated immorality can set in,
              which is often the case if a person does not control new
              riches within societal boundaries. What came first the
              chicken or the egg? What came first, the new system or the
              new morals? New morals which are accepted generate a new
              change of a system. This could imply that the chicken came
              before the egg and that the egg is the method which
              spreads chickens over earth. Evolutionary changes could
              cause a flying bird from a chicken’s egg. This flying bird

              ”............, let us treat the creation of a finished
              intellectual product as a two-step process. One step is
              thinking up the ‘idea,’ used here in the usual sense of
              the creative element or unique notion. The second step is
              the work necessary to employ the idea as the core of a
              finished product............................Edison had the
              idea of a light source produced by electrons traveling
              through a filament within a vacuum. He and his workers
              then spent weeks finding the proper filament material, the
              proper vacuum, and the proper electrical charge. These two
              steps represent the difference between idea and execution.
              Sometimes this difference is not readily visible or, when
              it does exist, the part we identify as the idea may seem
              the less important of the two components.”<o:p></o:p></span></big></big></p>

              that the idea is the less important is disputable. One
              could argue that the idea was the more important of the
              two because without the idea there would not be any
              utilities. Generating the idea is also an important
              attribute which distinguish humans from animals. Animals
              do not have hands. If humans did not have hands and could
              not communicate understandably it would have been much
              more difficult to implement ideas.<span
                style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Human
              development is dependant on hands and idea generating
              minds and both should be compensated. In a competitive
              economy compensation will determine what is done according
              to Locke’s labor proviso. Without compensation for idea
              creation the economy will not be competitive. If the idea
              did not originate, the hands would not have had anything
              to do. Therefore, generating the idea, add significant
              value because it creates work and helps to create
              utilities. The idea generating mind and the hands do not
              have to be part of the same human being. The handwork
              creates only the utility with not as much work being
              created by the handwork. During the handwork new ideas are
              generated but these ideas are mostly “obvious” and does
              not add unique value. To generate novel ideas and obvious
              ideas are not as common as handwork because of the honesty
              factor. The more honest persons are, the more likely they
              are to create ideas, because of logic, which is a result
              of honesty. The more people are dishonest, the more
              difficult it is to stay honest for people who want to be
              honest. To stay honest is difficult and therefore creating
              the idea because of persevering with honesty falls under
              Locke’s labour proviso which says compensation is
              warranted because of the unpleasantness of labour. To stay
              honest is an unpleasant labour of the mind. Without the
              idea, there would be no utility, therefore the
              “value-added” proviso is also fulfilled which warrants
              compensation for generating ideas. The idea generator
              often is an individualist and the handworkers are often a
              group. Between the idea generator and the handwork group
              there is the group who possess most of the Intellectual
              Property. The possessors also control most that is
              happening, with special reference to the level of
              compensation of the idea generator and the handwork group.
              Obviously the possessors think they have abundant
              financial security. Financial security is a factor which
              many idea generators and handworkers strife to, in order
              to increase their standard of living and expected

              right on an idea would make enforcing payment of royalties
              to the originator of the idea possible as in the case with
              patents. An IP right can include or not include the right
              to limit the use by others. The reasoning that an IP right
              on an idea is not acceptable because it will create a
              monopoly is invalid because the right could exclude the
              right of limiting use by others. The practise of not
              accepting income rights on ideas, penalises creativity
              because the creator is not compensated for the effort. In
              the American system of IP rights where the argument in
              favour of IP rights stems from the promotion and
              development of science and arts and utilities, this
              argument actually favors income rights to the creator of
              the idea due to the application of the creator’s idea by
              others, because it will encourage the creation of novel
              ideas and resultant utilities.<o:p></o:p></span></big></big></p>

              Hegel said a person can only be completely free if the
              person maximises self actualisation of his will. What he
              wants, he should be able to attain in order to be free.
              His will and personality is thus the motivation for
              property rights, because he wants to own and earn
              something to have dignity or financial security as an

              philosophy seems to be very subjective and depends on the
              will of each individual himself. It is a system but not a
              system because there are few generalisations. In reality
              it means that only a person who wants to live according to
              the law can actually be free according to Hegel. His will
              of wanting to live within the boundaries of the law comes
              from within and not from outside and therefore he is free.
              If the will of a person is to live outside the boundaries
              of the law he is not free because he will be in constant
              conflict with the authorities if he does what he wants. If
              he does not do what he wants it can be hardly said he is
              free. This is similar to what Jesus said. Love is to
              respect the law.<o:p></o:p></span></big></big></p>

              this work is characterized by overtly uitilitarian—even
              Benthamite—concerns. The assumption is that the principal
              or even sole criterion for evaluating intellectual
              property law is its contribution to aggregate utility, and
              that the legal regime governing ideal objects should aim

              by balancing off the welfare gain from innovations induced

              explicit of the proponents of this view is Judge Richard
              Posner. In spite of his criticism of Jeremy Bentham over
              the common law,³ Although Posner significantly parts
              company with Bentham over the common law³, with Bentham he
              sees the law’s function as maximization odf some quantity:
              in place of the norm of utility maximization, Posner
              offers “wealth maximization”⁴ This change, however, takes
              place within a framework that remains decidedly
              Benthamite; judges are still exhorted to aim at an
              explicit overall goal other than seeking justice in
              particular cases. Wealth is substituted for utility as the
              maximund, but the jurisprudential approaches remain
              consistent. As Posner remarks, “The basic function of law
              in an economic or wealth-maximisation perspective is to
              alter incentives.”⁵ In other words, the role of law is
              constructivistic and internventionistic, an attempt to
              reorder economic institutions to attain a particular end.<o:p></o:p></span></big></big></p>

              style="mso-no-proof: yes" lang="EN-US">Posner and his
              colleague William M. Landes have applied this model to the
              development of copyright in an attempt to explain “to what
              extent the principal features of copyright law can be
              explained as devices for promoting an efficient allocation
              of resources” and to show that “the principal legal
              doctrines” are “reasonable efforts to maximise the
              benefits from creating additional works minus both the
              losses from limiting access and the costs of administering
              and enforcing copyright protection.”⁶ Landes and Posner
              offer both explicit positive analysis of the law
              (purporting to show how it promotes economic efficiency)
              as well as exhortations to judges to apply the law so as
              to attain this end. For example, in discussing
              difficulties in applying the “idea versus expression”
              distinction central to copyright law to computer programs
              (to which the distinction is problematic), they state: “We
              hope the debate will be resolved not by the semantics of
              the words ‘idea’ and ‘expression’ but by the economics of
              the problem, and specifically by comparing the deadweight
              costs of allowing a firm to appropriate what has become an
              industry standard with the disincentive effects on
              originators if such appropriation is forbidden.”⁷<o:p></o:p></span></big></big></p>

              Copyright law includes the principals of fair use and the
              first sale doctrine. It means that in some instances

              library makes a book available to members of the library,

              broad approaches seem to dominate recent work in ethics:
              the consequentialist, the deontological, and the emphasis
              on character or virtue. The consequentialist approach
              evaluates an action (rule, policy, etc.) by its net
              consequences or effects. On this appraoch, for example,
              good policies are those that on balance do more good than
              harm for the people affected. The deontological approach,
              in contrast, appeals to universal principles on which a
              decision should be based rather than the actual outcome of
              that decision. On this approach, for example, a decision
              has moral worth if it respects a right, fulfills an
              obligation, or follows from a duty. Typically, such
              rights, obligations, or duties have a universal and
              necessary quality; that is, they would hold for anyone in
              a given situation, even if undesirable consequences would
              result form recognizing them. Finally, the third approach
              (that of so-called ‘virtue ethics’) emphasizes long-term,
              habitual character traits (virtues and vices) rather than
              actions, policies, or principles. <o:p></o:p></span></big></big></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:0cm"><big><big><span
              style="mso-no-proof: yes" lang="EN-US">On consequentialist
              grounds, for instance, one might argue that if allowing
              some algorithms to be patented benefits society in the
              long run more than it costs society temporarily to forgo
              unrestricted use of those algorithms, then such patents
              are morally defensible. The consequentialist approach
              reflects the spirit and motivation of U.S. law more than
              the other two approaches do. In contrast, elsewhere in the
              world (among other signatories to the Berne Convention),
              intellectual property laws smack more deontology. The
              French, for instance, appeal to what they call <i
                style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">droits morals</i>
              such as <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">paternité –
              </i>the inherent right of a creator to control the
              treatment of his or her creation, analogous to the alleged
              right that parents have with respect to their own
              children. On this approach, to infringe on a copyright is
              to violate a personal right, not merely to fail to uphold

              currencies and the cost of capital of the currencies.
              Normally when South-Africa buys high value foreign assets
              via the international monetary system South Africa has to
              borrow the foreign currency. South-Africa then pays
              interest on the borrowed capital and profit on the
              purchase of the assets. When South-African companies sell
              high value assets for example gold it is sold in United
              States Dollars. South-Africa does not earn interest on the
              sale through the lending of South-Africa Rands to finance
              the purchase. The United States Dollars earned by the gold
              companies can be used to purchase foreign assets, which
              could be nationalized by a foreign country. If the US$
              were first exchanged for Rands to purchase the gold the
              US$ would have been foreign reserves which are controlled
              by the South Africa Reserve Bank. Currently the US$’s are
              controlled by the gold companies. It seems though that
              South Africa could earn more by forcing the foreign buyers
              of gold to first borrow Rands and pay interest on the
              Rands to purchase the gold with Rands, instead of selling
              the gold in US$. If foreign buyers first borrow Rands to
              purchase gold, South Africa will not have exposure to a
              depreciating US$ which are held in reserve by the Reserve
              Bank or gold mines. Can a foreign country be forced to
              borrow local currency instead of buying the currency on
              the market? I doubt it, it has to be the choice of the
              foreign country, based on market rates whether it borrows
              or buy local currency to transact in it. The demand for
              the goods and commodities of a country and the balance
              between the interest rate and the availability of the
              local currency on the exchange market will partly
              determine how a foreign country gets hold of local
              currency to transact locally. The availability of the
              local currency on the exchange market will depend on the
              currency in circulation and the issue of new units of the
              local currency by the reserve bank. Foreign expensive

              borrowing foreign currency. China normally sells their

              the old colonial banking system has been generally
              replaced with very similar systems which allow privileged
              borrowers the lion’s share of available finance at low
              real rates while depriving the vast majority of indigenous
              farmers and industrialists of the finance they need.
              Professor Mckinnon gives examples from Ethiopia of
              moneylenders charging rates of interest of from 100% to
              200% in the rural areas while in the urban areas banks
              were charging importers 6 per cent and manufacturers 8 or
              9 per cent....Sixthly and finally, the Shaw-McKinnon
              thesis gives support to the ‘trade not aid’ and
              ‘bootstrap’ approaches to development. The authors show
              that much (though not all) aid is perverse in its

              derogatory because if a currency is weakening normally
              inflation goes up. This happens because of higher import
              prices. I assume there is a lag between the depreciation
              of a currency and the job creation because the development
              products do not immediately replace the imports (few
              jobs). Low inflation and an appreciating currency seams to
              lead to long term stable growth if management is good or
              revolution circumstances if management is bad, and a
              depreciating currency leads to revolution circumstances if

              (1967), and Evans (1965) reported moderate correla-tions
              (.40 to .60) between intelligence and their measures of
              mathe-matical creativity. Although Borgen (1971) found the
              creativity tests prepared by Guiiford and his associates
              to be significantly related to arithmetic achievement, the
              correlations between scores on Torrance's tests and
              mathematics achievement are usually rather low (Cicirelli,
              1965; Lanier, 1967). Finally, Evans (1965) and Banghart
              and Spraker (1963) also found significant correlations
              between their mathematical creativity measures and tests
              of achievement in mathematics.”<o:p></o:p></span></big></big></p>

              low correlations of general creativity with intelligence
              and academic achievement were not unexpected…Furthermore,
              Bentley (1966) states that tests of intelligence and
              achievement favor memory and cognitive abilities and
              consequently penalize highly creative students…Another
              possible cause of the low correlations between creativity
              and traditional tests of ability or achievement is the
              moderate reliability of most creativity tests, typically
              in the .80's. Also, the correlations among different
              measures of creativity are themselves frequently low, a
              fact that helps explain conflicting results obtained in
              studies employing different instruments…Yamamoto (1965)
              also concluded that the evidence from factor analysis does
              not confirm the existence of a separate creativity factor.
              Thorndike (1963), however, found some evidence for a broad

              the influence of heredity on mathematical abilities is
              debatable, at least one psychologist has offered a
              tentative physiological explanation for individual
              differences in these abilities. Krutetskii (1969 a, c)
              suggested that mathematical stimuli and activities affect
              the capacity or strength of nervous processes in a
              different way from other kinds of stimuli or activities.
              In addition, the nervous systems of some people may be
              more sensitive to stimuli having mathematical
              charac-teristics (relations, symbols, numbers) than to
              other stimuli. Their brains, in other words, are more
              easily "oriented" toward relationships and symbols and
              respond optimally to these kinds of stimuli. As a
              consequence, such individuals can form associations
              involving mathe-matics with less effort and retain them
              longer; they are also more resistant to fatigue that is
              specific to mathematical activity.”<o:p></o:p></span></big></big></p>

              occurrence of changes in mathematical abilities with age,
              in the direction of greater crystalliza-tion or
              specificity, is widely documented (Krutetskii, 1966; Very,
              1967; Dye &amp; Very, 1968; Geng &amp; Mehl, 1969). This
              observed fractionation of mental abilities as the
              individual matures was labeled by Dye and Very (1968) as
              the "Age Differentiation Hypothesis," a hypothesis that
              has stimulated further research (e.g., Khan, 1970). Not
              only is the degree of age differentiation in mathematical
              abilities greater for boys than for girls (Dye &amp; Very,
              1968), but it varies with the particular social or
              cultural group studied. Anastasi (1970) has interpreted
              these findings in terms of Ferguson's (1956) hypothesis
              that specific mental abilities result from transfer of
              training among the different tasks required of people in
              different sociocultural contexts. For example, the
              relatively greater emphasis in Western culture on the
              acquisition of verbal skills by girls, as opposed to
              quantitative and spatial-perceptual skills, may help
              explain why Dye and Very (1968) obtained a
              well-differentiated verbal factor but less distinct
              quantitative and spatial factors with girls than with

              don't use words like honesty and truth very often when
              they describe basic psychological processes. The words are
              difficult to define, almost guaranteed to make a
              metaphysical mess of things. One rare exception was Max
              Wertheimer. In his discussion of what he called
              "productive thinking," he wrote that "the feature of
              straightness, honesty, sincerity does not seem peripheral
              in such a process... even seemingly mere intellectual
              processes involve a human attitude, the willingness to
              face issues, to deal with them frankly, honestly,
              sincerely."' The essence of what I have to say in the
              paper at hand is that creative artists frequently use
              words like honesty and truth in describing them-selves at
              work: they contrast these with lies, faking, being glossy.
              They feel that honesty and truth are at the core of what
              they are doing in art.”<o:p></o:p></span></big></big></p>

              should add that the students were quite skeptical of the
              Wertheimer passage on honesty. Honesty, sincerity,
              commitment to the truth could be judged to be de-sirable
              personal characteristics, the students said, but they
              could not be requirements of a cognitive process. An
              insincere person could ar-rive at creative solutions in
              art, in science, and in life, they thought.”<o:p></o:p></span></big></big></p>

              Joel Spiegelman spoke of composing as a moment of truth,
              of his music as a mirror of himself. Jane Cooper spoke of
              writing poetry as honestly confronting one's experience.
              Grace Paley spoke of becoming an artist the day she
              discovered an absolute compulsion to tell the truth. Those
              are the data. The difficulties of understanding and
              defining a quality such as honesty remains a puzzle, and
              as psychologists, we have to struggle with it. Still, I
              think it is important that we take seriously what the
              artists say, that we not simply dismiss the result as an
              inter-esting, peculiar bit of verbal behavior of three
              artists. For one thing, other artists have been observed
              to make similar statements. Van Gogh, William Faulkner,
              Ezra Pound, and John Keats are just a few.5 It is an idea
              that seems to cut across time and media. In addition, the
              use of the terms like honesty and the context in which
              artists use them sug-gest something about the creative
              process itself.”<o:p></o:p></span></big></big></p>

              Roman&quot;;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold" lang="EN-US">This
              is what it suggests to me. First, it suggests that the
              product of the creative process is about something, it has
              a referent, and the re-ferent is something like the
              artist's experience of life, his personal vision of world
              and self. The referent is not clearly there in the
              beginning-not a self or an idea sitting there waiting to
              be expressed. Self-expres-sion is not just a matter of
              spontaneity. It is a struggle to confront one's experience
              honestly. It cannot be done except in a medium, and when
              the expression in a medium is finally clear, the artist
              has discovered something. Grace Paley said that she writes
              not when she is moved by an event but when "something
              buffaloes her"; Jane Cooper talked about discovering in a
              poem something you didn't know you had to say; Joel
              Spiegelman spoke of reaching out, of extending yourself,
              and of the difficulty of discovering the you. Second,
              though honesty to experience is seen as a goal, the
              relation between the work and experience is not obvious.
              The honesty is not a recitation of factual reality
              (Faulkner says truth doesn't have much to do with facts)
              but concerns an invented reality. Is the truth a
              meta-physical truth, a symbolic truth? This raises a whole
              set of fascinating questions. Furthermore, all three
              artists speak of dishonesty and lies and fakery in terms
              of form as much as content. The use of a glossy phrase or
              dramatic effects, the failure to work out an idea in terms
              of what comes before or what comes after, even the use of
              the word "very" where it doesn't belong--each is some sort
              of dishonesty and has to be rooted out. Third, since there
              is a task and a goal, a something to be expressed
              honestly, the creative process (at least in the arts, but
              I think also in most living cases) is a process that takes
              place in time - not in seconds or minutes but in weeks and
              years. Psychological analyses of creativity have used many
              different temporal units. Some study the word
              associa-tions that occur within seconds; others, the
              problem-solving that takes place in minutes; others
              describe creativity in terms of a total lifetime lived
              openly, lovingly, and without neuroses. However, in terms
              of art, in terms of the making of something, we are
              dealing with a long but finite temporal process with a
              beginning, a middle, and an end when the goal is reached.
              Fourth, the creative process is an intentioned process.
              Although some parts of it may involve making conscious
              what has not been conscious before, the artist cannot
              write a poem or paint a picture without in-tending to do
              it. It takes too much time, it is too complex a task, to
              do without intention. The artist must recognize himself as
              someone engaged in making something, and he must commit
              himself in terms of time and resources to his task.
              Furthermore, it involves the artist's selecting some of
              his ideas, insights, and inspirations, and rejecting
              others according to his own criteria. The artists told us
              that honesty and truth were basic criteria. Fifth, the
              artists see honesty as more central than other
              characteris-tics that are frequently mentioned as typical
              of creative work: original-ity and craft. All of them had
              respect for both, all spoke of the discipline needed to
              master the medium and of the fun and delight in invention,
              but somehow the core was honesty. Other artists have also
              said similar things. Marianne Moore was quoted as saying
              that "originality is a by-product of sincerity," and Ezra
              Pound that "technique is a test of sincerity."6 The words
              suggest that originality and craft are necessary tools for
              the basic task of honest statement. We can even see the
              oft-cited qualities of preference for complexity and
              tolerance of ambiguity as characteristics that are
              necessary because the basic task, the basic goal, requires
              an honest struggle through complexity and ambiguity
              without compromise or oversimplifying. Finally, some
              thoughts on honesty itself, in productive thinking,
              sci-ence, and art. The honesty that is the standard for
              the artist is a little different from the honesty Max
              Wertheimer spoke of in Productive Thinking (though I don't
              think he would disagree with what follows). Wertheimer was
              talking about a sincere commitment to a task, about a
              willingness to face its requirements. Even the ruthless
              confidence man of cliche, he who cleverly devises ways to
              trick people out of their money, must honestly face the
              requirements of his task: understanding the behavior of
              different kinds of people, being aware of how others see
              him, and so on. In the scientific enterprise, honesty
              itself is one of the requirements. No matter what a
              scientist's philosophy of science - ultimate truth or a
              heuristic theory-he may not lie about his observations. If
              dis-covered lying, he would be ostracized by the
              scientific community, as Bronowski points out.7 The
              artists seemed to be telling us that there is an analogous
              requirement in the arts, that there is a commitment to
              express in a concrete form, in a medium, a personal vision
              which com-bines thinking and feeling, a view of the world
              and understanding of self. They say that the work must be
              honest to this vision as the report-ing of data in science
              must be honest to what the scientist observes. How the
              artist develops his standard, how he ferrets out his lies,
              how he dredges deep for his truth- these are unanswered
              questions. The scientist's data are potentially public.
              But the artist's data are private. The truth or falseness
              of the finished work, the empirical product, can-not even
              be easily known, may never be known. Yet I think we need
              to take seriously, to be informed by, what the artists
              told us: that in terms of process this is the standard
              they use for themselves. Not clever-ness, or skillfulness
              in using the medium, or originality. Their standard is
              honesty. “<o:p></o:p></span></big></big></p>

              a loss. Jaspers describes the break as “monstrous” and as
              “disastrous” in its first effects.²³ “It is a period of
              catastrophic descent to poverty of spirit, of humanity,
              love and creative energy...as if the spirit itself has
              been sucked into the technological process.”’<o:p></o:p></span></big></big></p>

              and creativity. It is the case because the “bad” reign
              over the “good” because of the fear factor. Most people do
              not “see” God therefore they accept the worldly current
              reality and side with that logic in their daily actions,
              in order to enjoy life and put food on the table. It

              belongs to a system whereby a few (number depends on the
              level of corruption) honest people innovates creative
              ideas which could be the means of greater coherence in a
              society. Sometimes they get sacrificed by the deceitful
              groupies to benefit the groupies’ interests. Perhaps
              Christianity has given the greatest protection to the
              creative in monasteries and nunneries, which is partly the
              reason of the innovation which took place in the West. The
              Christian world is however losing this creative advantage
              because individual creativity is not protected against
              malicious group behaviour. The people in the nunneries and
              monasteries did not have children, which could be a reason
              to explain the halting of creativity along with deceit. In
              the U.S.A. people had freedom to be truthful because in
              their society they allowed the saying ‘Oh <b
                style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><i
                  style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">my</i></b> God’ It
              is a reflection of Revelation in the Bible and
              specifically the verse which says Christ will say what the
              name of God is on his return. In the Netherlands I think
              the constitution put the individual’s interests equal to
              that of the groupie’s interests but in South Africa the
              groupies’ interest is placed above that of an individual’s
              who is not part of the group who is committing sacrifice.
              The groupie and the individual are therefore not treated
              with equality, although they are each one person. In the
              constitution of the Netherlands people are treated equally
              because they get the same protection from the state,
              whether he is a groupie or an individual who does not
              belong to the groupie’s group. The groupie is not treated
              more favourably than the individual. It is thus possible
              to sacrifice a person for the good of a group if the
              sacrifice cannot be classified as a criminal offence, in
              South Africa. Such cases is seen as a civil matter which
              would cost millions to take to court and there are many
              other factors like fear which influence such cases The
              inner workings of a system are not common knowledge
              therefore the true treatment which the individual creators
              receive is not common knowledge (I had monetary
              payments/incentives and respect in mind when I wrote this
              sentence.) Maybe, in all descending human systems creators
              are isolated and that is the reason why humanity descends
              from an apex during history. In some cases it could be the
              individual creators who contribute to the descent through
              their blasphemy. In ascending human systems the individual
              creator is treated with due respect and due monetary gain
              and he does not blaspheme. The groupie and the individual
              in this sense can belong to the same group but the groupie
              belongs to another group within the group, which the
              individual is a member of. It is a scenario that could
              even be relevant within a family. The scenario repeats
              itself in many groups within groups within groups. If it
              is true what I heard about the South African and
              Netherlands constitutions the Netherlands constitution
              compare individual with individual and the South African
              constitution the individual with a group. Democratically
              the South African situation does not make sense.<o:p></o:p></span></big></big></p>

              them thus also from the possibility of truthfulness
              because it was part of a God which they could not interact
              with except through the church. When Protestantism
              appeared this barrier was removed and people could
              identify more with being truthful because the church was
              no longer between a person and God. This could have
              perhaps been the reason for the creativity which took
              place after Martin Luther’s preaching. People could
              identify more with truth and the God thought. Truth

              understanding of religious truth is naturally exemplified
              and clarified in his explicit discussions of religion, it
              is above all in certain recurring foundational ideas that
              the basis for that understanding is established. It is to
              those foundational ideas or, better said, that
              foundational thinking,¹ that attention must now be turned
              in an effort to map out the contours of the logic of
              religious truth. The crisis of the present, as noted
              above, consists in radical shaking of all previous
              foundations and the emergence of new conditions governing
              life and thought. It is that crisis, with its urgent
              struggle for the recovery of faith and the unprecedented
              possibility of a “common framework” for the communication
              of historically heterogeneous faiths, which has determined
              for Jaspers the present task of philosophical logic- -“the
              discovery of a simple, essential, and comprehensive
              foundational thinking.”² Said another way, while Jaspers’
              philosophy proposes no one system or set of doctrines,
              there is still a continually recurrent pattern of
              systematically thought and controlling ideas which are its
              determinative basis, “the ideas which govern its
              development.”³ It is, then, these ideas or patterns of
              thinking which establish the possibility of a plurality of
              true religions by distinguishing between the universality
              of truth in science and matters of fact and the absolute,
              yet never universalizable (sic), character of truth in
              matters of faith.’<o:p></o:p></span></big></big></p>
