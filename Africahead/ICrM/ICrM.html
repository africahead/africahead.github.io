        <p>Research about Intellectual Creations Management (ICrM) or in other words,  Accounting
             for ideas, started during 2009. The research to date is based on personal experience
              and literature studies.</p>
       
        <p>Currently own ideas are common property, unless protected by trade secret law, and securing
             remuneration or ownership benefits to flow from own ideas are difficult if not employed
              by the right organisation or if not part of the right group.</p>
            
        <p>ICrM aims to find ways to benefit from own ideas.</p>

        <h2>The anomaly of Plato? © 2012.10.15</h2>
        <p>“Like the philosophies of Heraclitus and Plato, and like those of Comte and Mill, Lamarck
             and Darwin, they are philosophies of change, and they witness to the tremendous and
              undoubtedly somewhat terrifying impression made by a changing social environment on
               the minds of those who live in this environment. Plato reacted to this situation by
                attempting to arrest all change.”¹</p>
        <p>ICrM and Intequinism postulate that creativities and changes are dependent on truths and 
            that truths cause changes. From the quote above it can be seen that Karl Popper’s opinion
             was that Plato tried to stop changes. There seems to have been anomaly in Plato’s reasoning
              because changes and truths are interdependent. Plato put much emphasis on truths as a value
               but he tried to “arrest all change”. [14 June 2013: See next blog entry for a different
                view.]</p>

        <h2>The anomaly of Plato? 2</h2>
        <p>According to Tarnas, Plato’s opinion is not clear because sometimes “Forms” were absolute
             stabilities, with changing immanent things substantially inferior to “Forms”. Elsewhere
              Plato seemed to have posited created immanent things to be of noble origins  because of
                “divine” origins of creativities.¹ [See previous blog entry for an opinion by Karl
                 Popper]</p>
        <p>The uncertainty, that Tarnas identified, and Popper also referred to, is investigated as
             an intequism of intequinism. The intequism is referred to as The anomaly of Plato?.</p>
        <p>Tarnas wrote: “.. a number of ambiguities and discrepancies remained unresolved in the
             corpus of Plato's work. At times Plato seems to exalt the ideal over the empirical to
              such an extent that all concrete particulars are understood to be, as it were, only
               a series of footnotes to the transcendent Idea. At other times he seems to stress
                the intrinsic nobility of created things, precisely because they are embodied
                 expressions of the divine and eternal.”¹</p>

             Have Shaped Our World View, p.11.  (New York: Ballantine Books, 1st Ballantine Books
              edition, 1993) - Permission for quotation received from Random House.</p>
        <p>Feyerabend opined the requirement of "stability" was the basis of Aristotle's philosophy.²
             This opinion opposes the hypothesis of Popper that Plato's requirement was unreasonable
              stability, when conjuncted with the idea that Plato and Aristotle had opposing philosophies,
               which at base levels differed. This statement of Feyerabend shows his definition of rationality,
                he opposed, related to Aristotle's rationality. Feelings that Feyerabend was maybe more in
                 line with Plato, than Aristotle could be right. In Plato's The laws at 711a the “Athenian”
                  (‘Plato’) says, the reason a “single supreme ruler” institutes the best government
                   and an oligarchy the least best is because a ‘single benevolent leader’ can allow
                    the "rapid and trouble-free transition", which is needed when progress is required.³
                     Currently it seems as if Aristotle required more unreasonable stability than Plato,
                      at their time, and,  antique Greek philosophy as a whole, required unreasonable
                       stability in today’s context. More than one benevolent leader are better for
                        a territory than one benevolent leader, because benevolent leaders do not
                         quarrel unreasonably, and they can resolve differences with reference to logic
                          and reason, without using force.  Intequinism rejects the antique Greek
                           hypothesis of Plato about The one, as well as the modern idea about The
                            savior, but recognizes the emphasis of those beliefs on truths.
                             Aristotle’s theses are not currently regarded viable as a starting
                              point, by Intequinism, because Aristotle motivated functional lies,
                               which remove trust. Plato’s, Aristotle’s and modern religious
                                ideas cause societal Caiaphas syndrome with the illogical
                                 psychological social behavior accompanying Caiaphas 
                                 syndrome.</p>
        <p>Changes, partly caused, research about Accounting of ideas and accounting for ideas; research
             about some of the root reasons of sacrifice. Truths, that cause creativities and change(s)
              and irrational sacrifice of creators (creatures), have not been rationally regarded, because
               currently, the “terrifying impression”, Popper referred to at the previous blog entry is used
                as motivation for sacrifices. Sacrifices are motivated by fear, and changes to privileged
                 positions, without realizing, that, the elimination of a cause (truths) for creativities,
                  cause eventual colonizations of territories, by other territories, that, did not sacrifice
                   own creators to the same extent. Reason being, that territories, which were colonized,
                    were behind with regard to technological development. Research showed a reason for
                     lacking creativities was societal sacrifice of creators. A change thus required, to 
                     be ahead, is belief, that, allows more creativities, than, being allowed, by current
                      beliefs.</p>

        <h2>Intequinism</h2>
        <p>Intequinism distinguishes between utilitarian development and good creative change.
             ‘Utilitarian development’ is dependent on infiltrations of others’ privacies and deceits,
              due to conceit. ‘Good creative change’ is dependent on respect and honesties.</p>
        
        <h2>Copyrights</h2>
        <p>Since formal research started about Accounting of ideas during 2009 several new words were thought
             of and used during the research. The most significant of these words are intequity, fonetones
              and honery. The multiplication rates of the words on the Internet are too high for the
               multiplications to be incidental. When the words were used the first time, checks were
                done to determine whether the words exist or not. The words do not appear in the Collins
                 English Dictionary nor did the words give search results with Google’s search engine.
                  During 2012 Google’s search engine gave the following number of search results for the 
                  three words. Intequity ≈ 115 000, honery ≈ 60 000, fonetones ≈ 80 000. The meanings
                   of the words today are as follow:</p>
        <p>The word Intequity was derived by combining the words equity and integrity.
             Entrepreneurship was divided between networking related and creating related matters.
              Intequisms use Intequity to refer to creating related benefits and equity to refer to
               networking related benefits.</p>
        <p>The word honery was thought of and first used with regard to honery testing. That is testing
             of the honesties levels of employees and members of management in order to determine the
              intequity value of a business. When the word was used the first time no search results
            were found for "honery" with Google's Search Engine</p>
        
        <h2>Ideas</h2>
        <p>According to intequinism, history can be interpreted, the result of interaction between two Forms
             (ideas), which all people are subject to. Truth and Love, developed during different times and
              at different places. Truth is correspondence and coherence between reality and words, and
               Love is universal law, based on the idea, not doing to others like selves want not to be done
                to. Truth, Love, social contract theory and laws are inherently interconnected.</p>
        <p>In China and Greece, for example, Truth developed, and after Truth, around 400 BC, Love started
             to develop in opposition to despotic truth. In Hebrew history Love developed with laws, when
              God gave the Ten Commandments. The idea, Truth was already established then, for example,
               in Egypt, albeit despotically.</p>
        <p>At and around the year ‘zero’ the two supreme ideas, Truth (correspondence and coherence) and
             Love (universal law), were being reconciled with Christian origins. Idolatry however, ever
              since hid the importance of the two ideas in balance, above all people. In reality it can
               be seen how human circumstances deteriorate when all people do not regard themselves
                subject to the two supreme Forms.</p>
        
        <h2>Intequinism</h2>
        <p>All humans are subject to two ideas; Truth and universal Love. Truth means, basically, correspondence
             and coherence between what is portrayed and portraying. Universal Love means, basically, not doing
              to others like selves want not to be done to. Social contract theory and universal laws developed
               from Love (not-doing evil). Truth without Love causes despotism and "love" without Truth causes
                lawlessness and disorder. Truth tempers universal Love and universal Love tempers Truth.
                 Sometimes it is not understood why these two ideas are above all people because, partly,
                  it can be profitable to deceive and do to others like selves want not to be done to. The
                   two ideas are important because compliance with the ideas causes order and creativity.
                    Without Love, disorder reigns and without Truth, creativities do not originate sufficiently
                     to support large populations. Currently, due to Caiaphas syndrome, which includes idolatry,
                      people who have good ideas, because they respect the two ideas above themselves, are
                       parasitized with utilitarian philosophy. Utilitarian philosophy promotes the development
                        of ideas but do not promote origination of good new ideas, due to 'sacrificing' "the
                         individual", "the stranger", "the other", in favor of groups.</p>
        <p>According to dialectical philosophy, essence is searched for, for example only Truth, or only universal
             Love. Intequinism is non-dialectical philosophy, in the sense that at least two ideas, Truth and
              universal Love, are respected above selves. Another example to explain the difference between 
              dialectic and non-dialectic philosophy is that Marx regarded labor, the essence of economics.
               He called labor "the creator". According to intequinism, Accounting for ideas is another
                aspect of economics, which should, at least, be regarded on par with labor.</p>
