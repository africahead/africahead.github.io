        <p>Divided Party (DiP) was the name of a political party with the objective to unite Left and Right in one party. The
        meaning of divide, in English, does not have the same meaning, "verdeel" (divide) to "deel" (share), has in Afrikaans.
        Therefor the name was changed to Federal Party SA (FPSA).</p>
        
        <p>DiP will in future function as a brand, promoting conciliation, mediation and dispute resolution. Divided Party (DiP)
        brand tokens are sold to raise capital for FPSA. The tokens carry 48% of the DiP brand value.</p>
        
           <p>DiP develops the idea self-determination, an opposing idea to "Unity". Imperialist indoctrination
           about "Unity" made "Self" irrational. The fallaciousness is included in many theories. For a long time,
          "Unity" has been the dominant idea in politics. Real unity is more probable when minorities' and individuals'
          self-determination and wills are respected. Self-determination is relevant at all spheres of life, from
          considering the whole world to considering a single household. "Unity" is the force of globalism and monarchism.
          "Unity" is based on only the idea Truth. The idea Love, the root of social contract theory; not-doing evil to all
          others like selves do not want evil done to, did not develop in imperialist "Unity" to respect the idea
          self-determination. It caused despotism, which can be seen in the way people have been subjected to torture,
          disrespect, ostracism and wars, for "Unity".
           </p>
          <p>The word Party implies unity. The word Divided, which implies self-determination, adds necessary balance
          to the name Divided Party.
