        <p>Foreword to The Republic:</p>
            <p>This publication makes Benjamin Jowett's translation of the Republic available,
             with Stephanus numbers and with anchors to Jowett's introduction. The anchors
              and Stephanus numbers make discourse possible, with reference to Jowett's translation and his
               comments, as well as with reference to other translations, which have Stephanus numbers.
            Jowett's translation was compared with other translations, especially the translation of Desmond Lee,
             published by Penguin. The different views of Desmond Lee and Benjamin Jowett are apparent, when
              comparing the different words they used. The different translations give different metaphysical
               views. The Republic, written around 380 BC by Plato, is one of the most influential books ever
                written. Socrates implied in the book that "the god" who originated the idea of beds, for example,
                 contributed substantially to the wellbeing of society and to job creation for carpenters. This
                  idea about creative "gods", coupled with the idea of the "The Creator" ("God"), cause Caiaphas
                   Syndrome, which negatively impacts Intellectual Property and sustainability of large populations.
            Understanding the psychological implications, relevant at "spiritual property" (as described in the
             Netherlands), is enhanced by reading the Republic. Republic and other books by Plato were used to
              abstract Plato's philosophy about Form, which could also mean philosophy about ideas. Basically,
               Socrates claimed that Form is the highest truth. Another important matter, is Socrates's method
                of reasoning, called dialectical reasoning. Dialectical reasoning, primarily, is a method whereby
                 essence is looked for. Contemporary non-reductionist philosophy, for example the philosophies
                  of Roy Clouser and Dooyeweerd, agree not with dialectical philosophy, because, according to
                   non-reductionist philosophy, putting emphases on different aspects and not putting emphasis
                    on an essence, is a more rational manner of reasoning. An argument, for example, can be;
                     Communism put too much emphasis on labour and thereby, another important matter, Accounting
            for ideas, was not regarded important enough. After studying non-reductionist philosophy another
             argument could be that putting emphasis on one idea only, for example "the truth", is irrational.
              Having at least two ideas, for example "the truth" and "love" (social contract theory) above self,
               is a more rational way to take decisions.</p>

        <p>The dialogue, Ion, is the shortest dialogue recorded by Plato. The dialogue is between Socrates,
             the well-known philosopher and Ion, a rhapsode.  They discuss various aspects relating to
              specialisation and innovation in work environments. Benjamin Jowett translated and commented
               on the dialogues of Plato. This version includes Stephanus numbers and par. numbers to Jowett's
                comments, which can be used for research purposes.</p>
