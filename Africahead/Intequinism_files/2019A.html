    <h2>Hypothetical Secular Afrikaans
            Region (SAR) - April 2019</h2>
            <p><b>Important: In the context of <a href="../DividedParty.html" target="_blank">Divided Party (DiP)</a>, this is a view 
              of only one region of interest. Leaders of DiP who do not identify with a 
              similar view, will form their own views to 
              be represented in DiP. Africahead will publish such
               views.</b>
            </p>
            <p>Sir Roger Scruton, the contemporary British philosopher wrote:
            "We have moved on a bit from the Middle Ages, it is not the man who is assassinated now,
            but only his character – but the effect is the same."</p>
            
            <p>What is the
          difference between communists/socialists and capitalists? Communists/socialists and capitalists hate
          God, but capitalists prey on and praise "God". <em>Intequinism</em> is new-capitalist philosophy.
          The hegemony of the Western world hampers necessary change,
            partly with ostracism, which is unacceptable methodology. In
            the process they appropriate ideas from the ostracized, to
            develop. Good ideas are primary sources of all capital,
            because without ideas, development would not take place.
            This realization and the realization that ideas are common
            property, which causes little remuneration rights, currently,
            is one of the important causes of <i>Intequinism</i>. Socrates called people 
            with good ideas "gods" and "goddesses". His opinion influenced the Eucharist.</p> 
            
            <p>The
            hegemony has failed and problems of the world were caused
            by them as leaders and lenders. They do not think rationally
            about one whole world. They think <a
              href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxXmz0Aisms" target="_blank">Malthus's</a>
            population theory is true; war is a major business of
            theirs. They do not believe <a
              href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DI4222l5poE" target="_blank">Boserup's</a>
            population theory. Boserup's theory and <a
              href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orpV6n9ls1o" target="_blank">Malthusian 
              irrationality</a>, which is "by the way", closely related to
            Caiaphas Syndrome of post-modernist thought, are explained on Youtube.</p>

          <p>Basically the proposed SAR
          according to <i>Intequinism</i>, is an aristocracy without a
          monarch (single leader at the top) and without any
            religious institutions. It is a new kind of feudalism.
          The previous feudal aristocracies' demise was caused
          by the nobility who were noble ("honest") "gods", but despotic, and
          the "ministers" of religion who were kind of loving (patronizing 
            charity), but not honest. In the SAR, the
          aristocracy, who will be the governors of the region, must not
          only be honest, but loving as well. Aristocratic titles will
          not be inherited, but earned with <em>honery</em> tests,
          replacing democratic elections. This could seem
            "undemocratic" but in the real sense of democracy the SAR
            will be more democratic than current democratic states,
            because citizens will be encouraged to share their good
            ideas with the government and employers, and payment for
            those ideas will be instituted. Currently, according
            to the utilitarian philosophical and religious dominant
            paradigm, ideas are common property, and ideas are
            appropriated from citizens by unlawful means without
            compensating.</p>

   <h2>Important primary considerations</h2>
            
            <h3>Capitalism and Communism</h3>
          <p>The two dominant government systems of recent times were
          capitalism and communism. The main difference between the two
          systems is, capitalism was based on idealism and communism on
          materialism. That implies, in capitalism, ideas played an
          important role and in communism the role of ideas was rejected
          in favor of materialism. In the SAR the role of ideas will be
          further enhanced by excluding religious and philosophical
          utilitarianism. The political system of the SAR can therefore
          be regarded as an improvement of current capitalist systems in
          the idealist tradition.</p>
          
            <h3>"Clean Slate"</h3>
          <p>The region can be formed on a "clean slate", whilst
          negotiating with the government of South Africa and the
          international community, according to the Constitution of
          South Africa. The law will, for example, be based on current
          logic and not Roman Dutch, English, or any previous regimes'
          laws. Naturally the legal ideas of those regimes will
          influence decision makers, but they will not be bound by
          precedents. Judgments will be done in groups, whilst
          considering the definitions of Truth and Love in the SAR
          Constitution. The negative influence of utilitarian sacrifice
          in the law, which causes current uncertainties and
          contradictions in Philosophy of Law, should be intentionally
          excluded, by considering favorably, the good changing effects
          individuals can have on society. <em>Intequity</em> should be
          instituted, whilst protecting creative individuals, who each
          is weak, against parasitic groups, who develop individuals'
          ideas, whilst excluding them. Individuals should be allowed to
          work with others, on the development of their ideas.
          </p>
            <h3>Religion</h3>
      <p>No religion will be allowed,
          partly due to the parasitic practice of religious communities,
          who excommunicate or ostracize fellow citizens as "the
          profane"; then praising them after their deaths. This
          religious business practice is basically, how idolatry
          functions, whilst killing falsely perceived enemies, as it was
          done since pagan times. People were regarded as enemies, if
          their ideas changed the status quo in favor of the whole,
          whilst having a possible damaging influence on power
          structures, due to change. The methodology of
          killing/sacrificing has changed, but the basic utilitarian
          idea stayed the same. The utilitarian idea is sacrificing one or a minority,
          for the benefit of the larger "Group". Currently the law cannot control such
          practices, therefore the law of the region must be updated to
          disallow such practices. Crimen Injuria and Intimidation particulalry, are
          difficult to prosecute, and much other criminality is caused by it.
          Socrates's view, should be taught to all people, in
          order to comprehend, how religious practices function
          fallaciously, with reference to the Eucharist.</p>
          <p>
          The faith of the SAR will be to have respect for the ideas
          Love and Truth, above all regionaires. Idolatry will be illegal,
          in conjunction with illegality of utilitarian philosophical
          ideas, according to which "the individual" (individuals) are
          sacrificed to benefit "the group". God is not, God are all living honest
          loving people plus Logos. God will thus be an international
          recognition, whilst considering all humans internationally,
          and their honesty and loving behavior. The idea of the Messiah
          or Christ will be regarded in a plural sense, due to the
          weakness of singularity, without scaring people 
          with end of the world scenarios. The functional lie about one man
          being "Christ" or "the Messiah", will be recognized for the
          devious influence it has had in history. The words "god",
          "gods", "goddess", "goddesses", and other similar words, will
          only be considered with regard to historical meanings. The
          words almighty God, having a plural meaning, due to the
          capital G and "almighty", can be used, due to the unavoidable
          nature of God's presence. "God himself", used by Plato, for
          example, in his book <em>the Laws</em>, and Aquinas's writing, is
          regarded as functional speech, to influence others falsely
          psychologically, regarding singularity, and will be illegal.</p>
          <p>
          Love will be defined in the Constitution and will mean primarily,
          not-doing evil to all other humans internationally, like
          selves do not want to have evil done to. This principal is
          well established in philosophy and has been promoted by, for
          example Confucius with his "Golden Rule". The law of Moses was
          also based on the principle, however not internationally.
          Social Contract Theory in an international sense, makes use of
          the idea. Currently in the West, this international idea of
          Love is not well-developed, because Social Contract Theory is
          primarily based on doing good to close others, like selves
          want to be treated, whilst contradicting itself with regard to
          "the profane". Current Western views of Social Contract Theory
          divide people of the same society among humans and "the-profane" or
          "the-heretics". Doing good to all others is impossible,
          internationally. The "Golden Rule" can be applied
          internationally, because not-doing evil can be not-done to all in the
          world. Love, will secondly be defined in a regional sense:
          Doing good to fellow regionaires like selves want to be treated.
          A problem arises regarding distances in doing good. Who will
          be regionaires' closest neighbors? What about family in other
          regions? This problem can be resolved by the law. Regionaires'
          wealth will be limited, whilst encouraging distributing wealth
          to all family, including those in other regions.
          Distributions of wealth to "foreign" family members will be
          controlled by SAR laws.
          "Foreign" family members will therefore have to honestly show,
          their wealth in total, do not transgress SAR limits, in order
          to be considered for distributions from the SAR.
          Maximum-profit-per-individual (empipi-i) will be prohibited. Regionaires
          will therefore be forced to distribute their wealth self to
          fellow regionaires, or do sport or another hobby, more regularly,
           once they each reach the limit. The limit
          will initially be low and will become higher as the region
          increases its wealth. Like in current Denmark, laws will be
          implemented to limit the inequality among citizens, by
          regulating the differences between lowest and highest
          salaries.</p>
          <p>
          Truth will be defined by the Constitution as correspondence, causing
          coherence. The idea Truth exists a priori at all people and
          therefore all humans have the ability to learn to speak. The SAR will
          work towards a world in which the idea Love also exists a priori.</p>
          <p>
          People who undermine and disrespect the regional definitions of
          the two ideas Truth and Love will be sanctioned by the region.
          Functional use of lies, for example the current use of
          "Messiah" and "Christ", in the singular form, will be illegal.
          The reason is, rational thinking can be compared to building
          puzzles in minds. If false puzzle pieces, enter minds,
          rational thinking is damaged. An aim of the SAR is to use
          faith, education and laws in a way to make all people, the
          most rational they can be. In order to accomplish this, <em>honery</em>
          tests will be done by all regionaires, partly determining their
          places in society. <em>Honery</em> tests will determine the levels of
          honesty and love regionaires each has. The most honest and most
          loving regionaires, according to their <em>honery</em> results,
          will have the most benefits in the SAR. Logically, they will
          be the people with the best ideas and will be the group from
          whom the government will be chosen.</p>
          <p>
          The purpose of having Truth and Love, respected above all
          regionaires is partly to have an orderly society and to influence
          evolution favorably, by enforcing the good ideas onto genetic
          memories.</p>

          <h3>Replacing religions</h3>
          <p>On Sundays, regionaires will have the opportunity to study
          philosophy and different religions, and how religions
          developed historically, without favoring one religion or
          philosophy over another. The ideas Truth and Love however will
          be favored above all other ideas. Special attention will be
          given, explaining how idolatry was functionally used
          historically, parasitising and excluding creative people; and
          how it relates to the ideas Truth and Love above all.</p>
          
          
          <h3>Freedom of Speech</h3>
          <p>If any regionaire feels s/he can prove, placing the ideas
          Truth and Love above all, is not good, s/he can enter
          discussions with the government and do research. If agreement
          with government is not forthcoming, s/he will go in exile to
          another region or country. If someone wants to add another good
          idea to the two primary ideas, on the same level, it will be possible,
          but must be regarded very seriously; deciding over a long period of
          time.</p>

          <h3>Divisions</h3>
          <p>Whilst considering, the region will
          be small, divisions will weaken the region substantially. No
          party politics will therefore be allowed. People will qualify
          to serve in government, according to <em>honery</em> tests. The
          highest scoring people will be the government, and they will
          act within the law. The twelve highest scoring
          individuals will work together, to take the most important
          decisions. No monarch will exist. If war becomes relevant, a
          general could have singular power to act quickly, but it can
          be limited by the twelve, who will be the highest decision
          making group of the SAR. Only if it can be shown, they
          disrespected the ideas Truth and Love, will their power be
          undermined by the justice system. Circumstances with regard to
          this will be determined by God and it is impossible to think
          how circumstances can develop. Therefore God are inherent
          parts to consider, for logical decisions. The twelve will have the power
          to overturn any decisions taken by the justice system.</p>

          <p>Other factors, which could weaken the region, are parasitic
          forces from outside, setting regionaires up against other
          regionaires, with bribes and other promises of foreign wealth.
          A public database will include each regionare's local and foreign net
          assets.
          Neighbors
           (all regionaires) in the region
          must have priority with regard doing good to, whilst
          considering only family in "foreign" regions and countries, as close
          neighbors, to do good to, even if in exile.</p>

          <h3>Property and Trade</h3>
          <p>All land and other assets like live stock, and crops, will be
          owned by the people in the form of public
            "companies". Esthetic planning of developments will
          be enforced. Tourism will be an important source of income. Planning to
          use the same land for farming and tourism will be a central task of
           government. 
          Improvements to land will be owned by the state/people
          in the form of public "companies". Individuals will own only
            shares/currencies in the public companies, and private
            assets, like residential buildings, most people
            currently own. Business will be divided between
          business, enhanced by competition, and business, not enhanced
          by competition. Business, not enhanced by competition, for
          example large infrastructure, will be the responsibility of
          the government, on a non-profit basis, without subcontracting
          their responsibility. All profits will accrue to the
            currency/share holders of the region and public companies.
          Citizens will be compensated with shares/currency in the
            SAR and public companies in an <em>intequible</em> way for profits
            gained and for other improvements, which add value to the
            SAR as a whole.</p>
          
          <p>Foreigners in business in the SAR, will not be allowed to
          repatriate profits to foreign countries. Transfer pricing to foreign
          regions and countries, will be strictly
          controlled by the government. Expatriate salary
          earners will be allowed to repatriate their salaries. All
            legal entities, including individuals, will have financial
            statements, which will be used to
                determine how shares/currency in the SAR is distributed,
            audited by SAR auditors. A limit will be placed on
            individuals' wealth.</p>
         
          <h3>Income</h3>
          <p>Each regionnaire will receive a basic income in shares/currency 
            in the SAR, for the upkeep of his/her residential property, within
             the means of the SAR, due to the
          effect of technology on unemployment, and the false conviction,
          everybody should "make a living". This false conviction has
          caused much fabricated functional nonsense entering the
          working world, through religion, research and
          entrepreneurship. The basic income should be enough to not work
          at all and practice one sport and/or art at a time, if
          possible. The most expensive sport, paid for by the state,
          will be golf and the most expensive art, allowed, will be
          music. If substantial foreign income can be earned by an
          expensive sport or art, the government will consider the idea
          for evaluation.</p>
          <p>Additional income for individuals' each will be generated by working
          and by selling good ideas to the government and public companies.</p>
          <p>A system for the evaluation of ideas, will thus have to develop. All
          regionaires will be taught, how the system works, at shool.</p>
        
        <p>Making 
        shares and ipparts (intellectual-property-parts) in the SAR and public companies,
        currencies, will
        place a natural constraint on the printing of money, due
        to the quantity theory of money. Currently <a href="../RaisingCapital.html" target="_blank">Africahead Ipparts (AFA)</a>
        <em>brand</em> tokens and <a href="../Moiom.html" target="_blank">Moiom (MIM)</a> <em>utility</em> tokens are issued by Africahead. The
        quantity theory of money can be used to value AFA, but only the supply/demand
        theory can be used to value MIM.</p>

          <h3>Monetary system</h3>
          <p>A regional currency/share system will be
          controlled by the government. Taxation will be replaced by
          printing of currency/shares by the government. The
          government will also print the basic income, which will be
          paid to each individual. Money/currency/shares/ipparts, will be
          printed, after ideas are valued for development, whilst
          considering already paid basic incomes. All ideas, which could
          be developed, will be considered by the government, and
          money/currency/shares/ipparts
          will be printed for the development of accepted researched
          ideas, or to reimburse regionaires for value added. No
          interest and no debt will exist. Businesses and areas within the region will
          be encouraged to develop their own currencies, also being
          shares/currencies/ipparts of businesses. These
          currencies/shares/ipparts, will be valued in the regional
          currency/shares/ipparts and will be traded on a regional
          Ipparts Exchange. Foreign businesses will also list their ipparts on
          Ipparts Exchange, if they accept honery tests. <a href="../Moiom.html" target="_blank">Moiom (MIM)</a>
          <em>utility</em> tokens
          will be the currency for Ipparts Exchange.</p>
          
          <h3>Reimbursements for value added</h3>
            <p>
            Distinctions will be made among value added to the SAR in the
            form of ideas, networking and labor, when reimbursements are
            calculated for value added to the SAR by individuals.</p>
         
          <h3>Non-profit business</h3>
          <p>All non-profit type business, like charities etc. will be
          the responsibility of the government. Current non-profit
          businesses, including religious institutions, are dependent on
          capitalist maximum-profit-per-individual (empipi-i). Therefore, current
          non-profit businesses are regarded as part of the problem of
          capitalism, because it indirectly cause the increasing
          inequality between richest and poorest people, due to
          dependence on empipi-i. Currently
          empipi-i is, due to religions, made
          first, then donations are made to non-profit institutions.</p>
         
          <h3>Planning</h3>
          <p>Ideas, except Truth and Love will be decided on primarily
          by the government, as they see fit, within the means of the
          SAR, whilst considering the negative effects laissez-faire
          systems can cause. The reason is, living honest loving
          people are the most rational. Truth and Love, the governing
          ideas of the SAR, will be included by definition in a
          Constitution. The government will be limited to the least
          number of required people, with a minimum of twelve. The
          twelve will have the highest salaries. They will have to work
          on average, thirty-five hours per week.</p>
          
          <h3>Defence Force</h3>
          <p>As part of primary and secondary education, and two
          years after secondary education, each citizen will be trained
          to defend the SAR. Each citizen will be expected to stay
          physically, fit enough, to serve this cause until their 60th
          birthday.</p>
          
          <h3>Education System</h3>
          <p>Tertiary education will be a privilege available, at no
          cost, according to the needs of the SAR, to the people who
          scored the highest marks in their primary and secondary
          education <em>honery</em> tests and other tests. The
          qualifying marks will be higher than current, to not
          overburden the education system, with people who will not use
          their education. Sunday's congregations will be part of the
          education system.</p>
          
         
          <h3>Workers</h3>
          <p>Honest and loving people (including farmers
          and religious ministers who rejected their previous
            idolatrous convictions), will work for the government and
             own residential property, they will be responsible for. The 
            government will evaluate, how good, residential property are looked 
        after, because good upkeep of the property will be partly why a basic 
        income will be paid to <em>all</em> people, including people of the government.
        A basic income begs the question: What 
      if work needs doing but no one wants to do the work? Basically work can be
       divided between thinking and doing. If the work is thinking, those with 
       the highest honery test scores will do the thinking and if the work is manual 
       work those with the lowest honery test scores will do the manual work. Importing 
       labour will be frowned upon.
         
          <h3>Health System</h3>
          <p>A complete reconsideration of medical services has to be
          done, due to false medical theories, especially at psychiatry,
          which is inherently based on false religious presuppositions. Palliative
          medicine is another field, which should be reconsidered,
          because maybe pain is nature's own way of healing. Another
          important consideration is, to what extent, should expensive
          modern technology, be allowed to save lives, if at all.</p>
          
          <h3>Key industries</h3>
          <p>Some industries, for example the media, will be regulated
          or run as non-profit business by the government, in order to
          exclude the non-loving and dishonest crap, seen in the media
          these days.</p>
          
          <h3>The arts and sports</h3>
          <p>Artists and sportspeople will be encouraged to do their
          arts and sports in such a way to earn the maximum foreign
          income, if they want to, whilst staying within the
          norms of foreign regions. A system of censorship will be relevant,
          at distribution of art and sport in the SAR.</p>
          
          <h3>Technology</h3>
          <p>It will probably be best to take a step back in time. The
          Amish showed how it can be done. Technology should be
          developed self, to limit imports. New ideas should be used to
          earn foreign income by developing the ideas self. Self
          development and exports of the fruits thereof are primary
          objectives. Good ideas and its development will show respect
          for the ideas Truth and Love.</p>
          
          <h3>Development</h3>
            <p>Apart from normal development like roads,
            telecommunications etc., which will be done by the SAR
            regionaires, with free available technology, and own new technology, the following will
            be built. Twelve beautiful resorts, each with a beautiful
            furnished castle/palace, for the twelve top
            leaders of the region. The furnishings and art will be from
            the best SAR artisans. All the citizens will have time share
            in the resorts, according to their <em>honery</em>
            test results, some in the castles/palaces. The length of paid leave 
        will be adjusted to limit unemployment. If regionaires, who
    want to work, are unemployed, paid leave of employed regionaires will be
     increased, to keep all people who want to work employed.</p>
          
          <h3>Entrepreneurship</h3>
          <p>Entrepreneurship is religious dogma, based on
          maximum-profit-per-individual (empipi-i) and other ideas about
          singularity of "Christ" ("the Messiah"). The role of people
          with creative good ideas, historically called "gods" by
          Socrates, influencing Christianity, will be appreciated, not
          in an idolatrous way. The dominant current role of developers,
          should be adjusted. Cooperation between creative people and
          developers will be promoted by the education system.</p>

          <h3>Honery tests</h3>
          <p>The purpose of <em>honery</em> tests will be to ascertain
          the respect for the two ideas Truth and Love according to the
          Constitution. The tests will have to be historical and future
          orientated; how will people, especially the government,
          respect the ideas in the future? It cannot be only
          historically based, because history has shown people have a
          chance to change their ways for good. <em>Honery</em> tests for
          Love has to focus on international Love, primarily, because
          when international Love and national Love are considered,
          contradictions can occur. It is possible to do evil to
          "foreigners" in order to do good to neighbors, but that is not
          the idea for Love. Love are international and national, but
          primarily, international.</p>
       
          <h3>Gender</h3>
            <p>Gender is a very topical issue of current
            politics. New gender theories were falsely based on
            subjectivity, and not objective material facts, it seems.
            Although new gender laws, for example in Canada, protect
            individuals from falsely being called gay, by the Caiaphaci,
            the laws seem to also promote irrational subjectivity about
            selves, and confuse many people. A male cannot be changed
            into a female with an operation. The SAR will not allow such
            fallacious medical theories and practices, to disrupt the
            order of society and individuals self. The idea Truth,
            protected in the Constitution, will ascertain objective
            theories, people can agree to generally, with a common
            reference point, without allowing subjectivity.
            Ultimately the presence of a uterus, at birth, which can form
            children, differentiates female from male, without knowing
            too much, getting lost in false theoretical crap and
            subjective cosmological pneumatology. From a man's point of
            view, if males regard other males, because of their smell
            and poisoned funk times, as female, the men who are misled
            by their senses of smell, should start praying seriously for
            their own souls and change their merry ways.</p>
            <p>The different roles of males and females in society will
            be more traditional, because of unemployment. Women
            entering the workplace, caused much unemployment, which is
            currently a big problem. Only one of a family will be allowed to
            work, depending on salary levels also, if unemployment is a problem.</p>
            <p>Gender issues will be determined primarily based on biology and physics,
            most visible. Generalisations will not be made and gender will be considered
            on an individual basis, without allowing, subjectivity of "Self" to override
            objective biological physical correspondence.</p>
