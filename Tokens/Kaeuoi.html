        <p>The Kaeuoi Internet Community Project will be funded from capital raised by issues of Kaeuoi (KAE) brand tokens
        and <a href="../Africahead/Moyom.html" target="_blank">Moyom (MYM)</a> utility tokens. Anyone can earn 17% commission
        when finding buyers for the tokens.</p>

        <h2>Objective</h2>
        
        <p>Kaeuoi can be compared to a labour union, representing the opposite than usual. Thus, instead of having the labour
        theory of capital as a root of its existence, Kaeuoi has Intequity (Capital of ideas) as a root, combining it with
        labour. The purpose is for Internet users, to group together against exploitation
        on the Internet. Lately the news showed clearly, Internet users are exploited, especially by social media websites,
        imparting ("stealing") ideas and personal information, making vast amounts of money from it, with advertising, e.g..
        Kaeuoi Community will be, ones could say,
        a migrant community on the Internet, to "greener pastures", if they are not sufficiently respected by the-exploiting.
        The Kaeuoi Community will use their group power to negotiate better circumstances
        for the group and individuals each on the Internet. An example of how group power can be used, is, diverting advertising
        income to Kaeuoi Community members. If website owners and managers will not be willing to share
        advertising income with Internet users, the Kaeuoi Community can migrate to other websites, where they are considered
        more. Individuals and the group will be represented in court cases and tort law suits. Kaeuoi is thus also a kind of
        insurance against exploitation on the Internet.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Becoming a Member</h2>
        
        <p>Owning Kaeuoi (KAE) tokens will prove membership. The financial benefits when it realize will be distributed to KAE
        token holders. Group communication will happen at the Kaeuoi group on the cent.co and
        <a href="https://www.minds.com/groups/profile/1039034053487591424/feed" target="_blank">minds.com</a> social media sites.
        Direct Message @mdpienaar at
        <a href="https://beta.cent.co/@mdpienaar" target="_blank">cent.co</a> to be added to the group or request at
        <a href="https://www.minds.com/groups/profile/1039034053487591424/feed" target="_blank">the group</a> on minds.com
        to be added to the group. Members
        are needed on all social media websites to build the Kaeuoi
        Community. The larger the Kaeuoi Community is, the more power management will have to negotiate benefits for KAE token
        holders.</p>
        
        <h2>Financial Benefits of Being a Member</h2>
        
        <p>Monetary benefit could be applicable with regard to capital appreciation of KAE tokens. The issue prices increase, therefore
        the earliest buyers get the best value for money. There isn't a fixed policy of how materialized
        monetary value will be distributed to the ETH addresses, holding KAE tokens. The strength of Kaeuoi is in numbers of members
        and negotiating strength, rooted in the law about e.g. privacy, trade secrets and "migration",
        therefore, distributions, can logically not be done according to value invested. If only one hodler, e.g. owns all the
        KAE tokens, and is the only member of Kaeuoi Internet Community, supplying all the capital, the "Community" will have no
        power, because the power of
        the Community is in withdrawing their use from a website and/or using another website or in tort law. Getting the maximum
        number of KAE holders
        is important. Currently
        a minimum number of members and minimum amount of capital raised, before negotiations with Internet service providers will
        take place are:
        (1) At least 1 million KAE token holders. (2) At least 1000 ETH value raised. 1 million KAE holders might give negotiating strength
        needed, especially if they are all existing users of one website or could be of a new website. 1000 ETH value might be enough
        to get the necessary legal advice.
        </p>
        
        <p>When
        calculating the maximum distribution to an ETH address, currently, 1000 KAE will be the maximum number of tokens attracting
        value. The figure of 1000 KAE can change. Members should thus not hold more KAE tokens than the maximum, which is currently
        1000 KAE. An owner of KAE tokens, who bought tokens, not-for-speculation, must hold all KAE tokens in only one ETH address.
        If one person, e.g. bought 2000 KAE tokens and split the tokens into two ETH addresses, only one ETH address will be
        considered, as far as possible.
        </p>

        surrounds, starting with good ideas. Choosing idealism as dominant over materialism implies a choice is made for
        survival with creative ways. It is a choice in favour of the ideas Truth and Love and in favour of universal laws.
        It is a choice in favour of groups Being good. Choosing idealism implies considering value added by labour and

        <p>In the above orientation, it refers to others' souls and comprehension of
        materialism as opposed to idealism. Materialism basically means, humans are determined by matter and their
        surrounds. Choosing materialism as dominant over idealism, means a choice is made for survival by murderous means.
        It is a choice against the ideas Truth and Love and against universal laws. It is a choice in favour of idolatry,
        messianism, apocalypticism and evil singularity. Choosing materialism means trust in only the labour theory of capital,
        whilst imparting ideas, without remunerating people for good ideas.</p>
